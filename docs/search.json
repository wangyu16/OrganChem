General Concepts in Chemistry\nChemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.\nMatter is anything that occupies space and has mass.\nA substance is a form of matter that has a definite composition and distinct properties.\nA mixture is a combination of two or more substances in which the substances retain their distinct identities.\n\nHomogenous mixture – composition of the mixture is the same throughout.\nHeterogeneous mixture – composition is not uniform throughout.\n\nAn element is a substance that cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means.\nA compound is a substance composed of atoms of two or more elements chemically united in fixed proportions.\n\n\n\nThe three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.\n\n\nA physical change does not alter the composition or identity of a substance.\nA chemical change alters the composition or identity of the substance(s) involved.\nAn extensive property of a material depends upon how much matter is being considered (mass, length, volume, etc.).\nAn intensive property of a material does not depend upon how much matter is being considered (density, temperature, color, etc.).\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts"

    "text": "3. Numbers\n\n3.1 Scientific Notation\nAll numbers can be expressed in the form\n\\[N\\times10^n\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is a number btween 1 and 10 and \\(n\\), the exponent, is a positive or negative integer. Any number expressed in this way is said to be written in scientific notation.\nFor example,\n\\[568.762 = 5.68762\\times10^2\\]\nbecause the decimal point is moved to the left by two places and \\(n=2\\).\n\\[0.00000772 = 7.72\\times10^{-6}\\]\nbecause the decimal point is moved to the right by 6 places and \\(n=-6\\).\nAddition and Subtraction\nFirst write each quantity with the same exponent; then, combine them.\n\\[4.31\\times10^4 + 3.9\\times10^3 = 4.31\\times10^4+0.39\\times10^4=4.70\\times10^4\\]\nMultiplication and Division\nTo multiply numbers, we multiply \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) in the usual way, but add the exponents together. To divide, we divide \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) as usual and subtract the exponents.\n\\[(8.0\\times10^4)\\times(5.0\\times10^2)=(8.0\\times5.0)(10^{4+2})=40\\times10^6=4.0\\times10^7\\]\n\\[\\frac{8.5\\times10^4}{5.0\\times10^9}=\\frac{8.5}{5.0}\\times10^{4-9}=1.7\\times10^{-5}\\]\n More Information about scientific notation\n\n\n\n3.2 Significant Figures\n\nOpenStax 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision. Brown 1.6 Uncertainty in Measurement\nRules\n\nAny digit that is not zero is significant.\nZeros between nonzero digits are significant.\nZeros to the left of the first nonzero digit are not significant.\nIf a number is greater than 1, then all the zeros written to the right of the decimal point count as significant figures.\nFor numbers that do not contain decimal points, the trailing zeros may or may not be significant (There are different definitions in different textbooks). Thus, using scientific notation is recommended to avoid the ambiguity.\n\nHandling significant figures in calculations\n\nIn addition and subtraction, the answer cannot have more digits to the right or the decimal point than either of the original numbers.\nIn multiplication and division, the number of significant figures in the final product or quotient is determined by the original number that has the smallest number of significant figures.\nExact numbers obtained from definitions or by counting numbers of objects can be considered to have an infinite number of significant figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Accuracy and Precision\nAccuracy tells us how close a measurement is to the true value of the quantity that was measured.\nPrecision refers to how closely two or more measurements of the same quantity agree with one another.\n\n\n3.4 Significant Figures in Measurement\nThe numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface of the liquid. In the following figure, the bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid’s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL. \n\nExample: Determine the number of significant figures. (a) 358 m; (b) 35.1 g; (c) 0.932 kg; (d) 0.0068 m; (e) \\(9.320\\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{molecules}\\); (f) 3400 mL.  Answer: (a) 3; (b) 3; (c) 3; (d) 2; (e) 4; (f) 2 or 4. \nExample: Do the following operations giving answers with correct number of significant figures.

    "text": "1. Atoms\n\n1.1. The Structure of Atoms\nDalton’s Atomic Theory (1808)\n\nElements are composed of extremely small particles called atoms.\n\nAll atoms of a given element are identical, having the same size, mass and chemical properties. The atoms of one element are different from the atoms of all other elements.\n\nCompounds are composed of atoms of more than one element. In any compound, the ratio of the numbers of atoms of any two of the elements present is either an integer or a simple fraction.\n\nA chemical reaction involves only the separation, combination, or rearrangement of atoms; it does not result in their creation or destruction.\n\nThe Structure of Atoms\nAn atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers.\nEvery atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom’s mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.\nRutherford’s Model of the Atom\n\n\n\nCompare the mass and charges of subatomic particles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle\nMass (g)\nCharge (C)\nCharge unit\n\n\n\n\nElectron\n\\(9.10938\\times 10^{-28}\\)\n\\(-1.6022\\times 10^{-19}\\)\n\\(-1\\)\n\n\nProton\n\\(1.67262\\times 10^{-24}\\)\n\\(+1.6022\\times 10^{-19}\\)\n\\(+1\\)\n\n\nNeutron\n\\(1.67493\\times 10^{-24}\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\nRadioactivity\nRadioactivity describes the spontaneous emission of particles and/or radiation. Consequently, any element that spontaneously emits radiation is said to be radioactive.\n\\(\\alpha\\)-radiation: Alpha radiation occurs when an atom undergoes radioactive decay, giving off a particle (called an alpha particle) consisting of two protons and two neutrons (essentially the nucleus of a helium-4 atom).\n\\(\\beta\\)-radiation: Beta radiation takes the form of either an electron or a positron (a particle with the size and mass of an electron, but with a positive charge) being emitted from an atom.\n\\(\\gamma\\)-radiation: Gamma rays are penetrating electromagnetic radiation of a kind arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. It consists of photons in the highest observed range of photon energy.\nX-ray: X-radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-Rays are longer-wavelength and (usually) lower energy than gamma radiation.\n\n\nImportant Experiments\n(Just to have a brief idea how the subatomic structures were discovered.)\nMeasurement of the mass/charge ratio of electrons by J.J. Thomson\nCathode ray is a beam of electrons emitted from the cathode of a high-vacuum tube.\nCathode ray tube is a high-vacuum tube in which cathode rays produce a luminous image on a fluorescent screen, used chiefly in televisions and computer terminals. In some experiments, two electrically charged plates and a magnet were added to the outside of the cathode ray tube. The external electric field and magnetic field can change the trajectory of the cathode ray (electrons). The ratio of electric charge to the mass of an individual electron can be calculated based on electromagnetic theory.\nMeasurement of the mass of electrons by Millikan\nThe experiment entailed observing tiny electrically charged droplets of oil located between two parallel metal surfaces. when the gravitational force and external electric force are balanced, the charge on the oil droplet can be calculated. By repeating the experiment for many droplets, they confirmed that the charges were all small integer multiples of a certain base value, which was found to be \\(1.5924(17)\\times10^{−19}\\,\\text{C}\\), about \\(0.6\\%\\) difference from the currently accepted value of \\(1.602176487(40)\\times10^{−19}\\,\\text{C}\\).\nRutherford’s Experiment (This is important!)\nRutherford carried out a series of experiments using very thin foils of gold and other metals as targets for α particles from a radioactive source. He observed that the majority of particles penetrated the foil either undeflected or with only a slight deflection. In some instances, an α particle actually bounced back in the direction from which it had come! To explain the results of the α-scattering experiment, Rutherford devised a new model of atomic structure, suggesting that most of the atom must be empty space. This structure would allow most of the α particles to pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection. The atom’s positive charges, Rutherford proposed, are all concentrated in the nucleus, a dense central core within the atom. Whenever an α particle came close to a nucleus in the scattering experiment, it experienced a large repulsive force and therefore a large deflection. Moreover, an α particle traveling directly toward a nucleus would experience an enormous repulsion that could completely reverse the direction of the moving particle.\nChadwick’s Experiment\nIt was known that hydrogen, the simplest atom, contains only one proton and that the helium atom contains two protons. Therefore, the ratio of the mass of a helium atom to that of a hydrogen atom should be 2:1. (Because electrons are much lighter than protons, their contribution can be ignored.) In reality, however, the ratio is 4:1. Rutherford and others postulated that there must be another type of subatomic particle in the atomic nucleus; the proof was provided by another English physicist, James Chadwick, in 1932. When Chadwick bombarded a thin sheet of beryllium with α particles, a very high energy radiation similar to γ rays was emitted by the metal. Later experiments showed that the rays actually consisted of electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons. Chadwick named these particles neutrons.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand Dalton’s Atomic Theory.\n\nUnderstand Rutherford’s Experiment.\n\nUnderstand the structure of atoms.

A metal is a good conductor of heat and electricity, whereas a nonmetal is usually a poor conductor of heat and electricity. A metalloid has properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals.\nThe Group 1A elements (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr) are called alkali metals, and the Group 2A elements (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra) are called alkaline earth metals.

    "text": "2. Molecules and Ions\n\n2.1. General Concepts\nOf all the elements, only the six noble gases in Group 8A of the periodic table (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn) exist in nature as single atoms. For this reason, they are called monatomic (meaning a single atom) gases. Most matter is composed of molecules or ions formed by atoms.\n\nMolecules\nA molecule is an aggregate of at least two atoms in a definite arrangement held together by chemical forces (also called chemical bonds).\nThe hydrogen molecule, symbolized as \\(\\ce{H2}\\), is called a diatomic molecule because it contains only two atoms. Molecules containing more than two atoms are called polyatomic molecules.\n\n\nOrganic Compounds\nOrganic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with carbon compounds. The simplest type of organic compounds is the hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms.\nExample: methane \\(\\ce{CH4}\\)\nThe chemistry of organic compounds is largely determined by the functional groups, which consist of one or a few atoms bonded in a specific way. For example, when an \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom in methane is replaced by a hydroxyl group (\\(\\ce{—OH}\\)), an amino group (\\(\\ce{—NH2}\\)), and a carboxyl group (\\(\\ce{—COOH}\\)), the following molecules are generated: methanol (\\(\\ce{CH3OH}\\)), methylamine (\\(\\ce{CH3NH2}\\)), acetic acid (\\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\)).\n\n\nIons\nAn ion is an atom or a group of atoms that has a net positive or negative charge.\nThe loss of one or more electrons from a neutral atom results in a cation, an ion with a net positive charge. For example, a sodium atom (\\(\\ce{Na}\\)) can readily lose an electron to become a sodium cation, which is represented by \\(\\ce{Na+}\\).\nAn anion is an ion whose net charge is negative due to an increase in the number of electrons. A chlorine atom (\\(\\ce{Cl}\\)), for instance, can gain an electron to become the chloride ion \\(\\ce{Cl^{−}}\\).\nSodium chloride (\\(\\ce{NaCl}\\)), ordinary table salt, is called an ionic compound because it is formed from cations and anions.\nIons like \\(\\ce{Na+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cl^{−}}\\) are called monatomic ions because they contain only one atom. Figure 2.10 shows the charges of a number of monatomic ions. With very few exceptions, metals tend to form cations and nonmetals form anions.\nPolyatomic ions such as \\(\\ce{OH^{−}}\\) (hydroxide ion), \\(\\ce{CN^{−}}\\) (cyanide ion), and \\(\\ce{NH4+}\\) (ammonium ion) are ions containing more than one atom.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand and remember the concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Chemical Formuas\nChemists use chemical formulas to express the composition of molecules and ionic compounds in terms of chemical symbols.\n\nMolecular Formulas\nA molecular formula shows the exact number of atoms of each element in the smallest unit of a substance.\nAn allotrope is one of two or more distinct forms of an element. Two allotropic forms of the element carbon—diamond and graphite—are dramatically different not only in properties but also in their relative cost.\nEmpirical Formulas\nAn empirical formula shows the simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms in a substance. For example, hydrogen peroxide \\(\\ce{H2O2}\\) has the empirical formula as \\(\\ce{HO}\\).\nMolecular Models\nMolecules are too small for us to observe directly. An effective means of visualizing them is by the use of molecular models.\n\n\nFormulas of Ionic Compounds\nIonic compounds consist of a combination of cations and anions.\n\nThe formula is usually the same as the empirical formula.\n\nThe sum of the charges on the cation(s) and anion(s) in each formula unit must equal zero.\n\n\nExample:  Determine the formula of lead(IV) Oxide. \nAnswer: \nThe cation is \\(\\ce{Pb^4+}\\) and the oxygen anion is \\(\\ce{O^{2−}}\\). The following diagram helps us determine the subscripts for the compound formed by the cation and the anion:\n\n\n\nThe formula of the compound is \\(\\ce{Pb2O4}\\). We should reduce the subscripts to the lowest ratio, and get \\(\\ce{PbO2}\\). The sum of the charges is \\(1\\times(+4) + 2(−2) = 0\\). Thus, the formula for led(IV) oxide is \\(\\ce{PbO2}\\).\n\nMore examples see here.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand and remember the concepts."

Molecular Compounds\nUsually, molecular compounds are coumpounds with nonmetals or nonmetals + metalloids\n\nCommon names may be used, such as water \\(\\ce{H2O}\\), ammonia \\(\\ce{NH3}\\), methane \\(\\ce{CH4}\\).\n\nElement furthest to the left in a period and closest to the bottom of a group on periodic table is placed first in formula.\n\nIf more than one compound can be formed from the same elements, use prefixes to indicate number of each kind of atom, such as carbon monoxide \\(\\ce{CO}\\) and carbon dioxide \\(\\ce{CO2}\\).\n\nLast element name ends in -ide.\n\nGreek prefixes:\n\n\n\nPrefix\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmono-\n1\n\n\ndi-\n2\n\n\ntri-\n3\n\n\ntetra-\n4\n\n\npenta-\n5\n\n\nhexa-\n6\n\n\nhepta-\n7\n\n\nocta-\n8\n\n\nnona-\n9\n\n\ndeca-\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Acids\nAn acid can be defined as a substance that yields hydrogen ions (\\(\\ce{H+}\\)) when dissolved in water.\nFor example, \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) gas as a pure substance is named as hydrogen chloride. When \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) is dissolved in water, hydrochloric acid is formed giving \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cl^{-}}\\).\n(Most complicated part!) An oxoacid is an acid that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and another element. The formulas of oxoacids are usually written with the H first, followed by the central element and then O. We use the following five common acids as our references in naming oxoacids:\n\n\n\nAcid\nAcid Name\nAcid\nAcid Name\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\ce{H2CO3}\\)\ncarbonic acid\n\\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\)\nphosphoric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO3}\\)\nchloric acid\n\\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\)\nsulfuric acid\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HNO3}\\)\nnitric acid\n\n\n\n\n\nOften two or more oxoacids have the same central atom but a different number of O atoms. Starting with our reference oxoacids, whose names all end with “-ic,” we use the following rules to name these compounds.\n\nAddition of one O atom to the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “per… -ic” acid. Thus, adding an O atom to \\(\\ce{HClO3}\\) changes chloric acid to perchloric acid, \\(\\ce{HClO4}\\).\n\nRemoval of one O atom from the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “-ous” acid. Thus, nitric acid, \\(\\ce{HNO3}\\), becomes nitrous acid, \\(\\ce{HNO2}\\).\n\nRemoval of two O atoms from the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “hypo… -ous” acid. Thus, when \\(\\ce{HBrO3}\\) is converted to \\(\\ce{HBrO}\\), the acid is called hypobromous acid.\n\nThe rules for naming anions of oxoacids, called oxoanions, are\n\nWhen all the H ions are removed from the “-ic” acid, the anion’s name ends with “-ate.” For example, the anion derived from \\(\\ce{H2CO3}\\) is called carbonate.\n\nWhen all the H ions are removed from the “-ous” acid, the anion’s name ends with “-ite.” Thus, the anion derived from \\(\\ce{HClO2}\\) is called chlorite.\n\nThe names of anions in which one or more but not all of the hydrogen ions have been removed must indicate the number of H ions present. For example, consider the anions derived from phosphoric acid:\n\n\\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) : Phosphoric acid\n\\(\\ce{HPO4^{2-}}\\) : Hydrogen phosphate\n\\(\\ce{H2PO4^{-}}\\) : Dihydrogen phosphate\n\\(\\ce{PO4^{3-}}\\) : Phosphate\nNames of Oxoacids and Oxoanions That Contain Chlorine\n\n\n\nAcid\nAcid Name\nCorresponding Anion\nAnion Name\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO4}\\)\nperchloric acid\n\\(\\ce{ClO4-}\\)\nperchlorate\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO3}\\)\nchloric acid\n\\(\\ce{ClO3-}\\)\nchlorate\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO2}\\)\nchlorous acid\n\\(\\ce{ClO2-}\\)\nchlorite\n\n\n\\(\\ce{HClO}\\)\nhypochlorous acid\n\\(\\ce{ClO-}\\)\nhypochlorite\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Bases\nA base can be defined as a substance that yields hydroxide ions (\\(\\ce{OH-}\\)) when dissolved in water, such as sodium hydroxide \\(\\ce{NaOH}\\).\n\n\n3.5 Hydrates\nHydrates are compounds that have a specific number of water molecules attached to them, such as copper sulfate pentahydrate \\(\\ce{CuSO4}\\cdot\\ce{5H2O}\\).\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand and remember the concepts."

    "text": "1. Molar Mass\n\n1.1. Atomic Mass\nAtomic mass is the mass of an atom in atomic mass units (amu)\nOne atomic mass unit equals to \\(1/12\\) of the mass of one \\(\\ce{^{12}C}\\) atom.\nOn this scale the atomic mass of \\(\\ce{^{1}H}\\) is 1.008 amu, NOT exactly 1 amu because the mass of one proton varies in different atoms.\nAverage atomic mass is the weighted average of all of the naturally occurring isotopes of the element. (The number below every element symbol in the periodic table)\n\nExample:  The atomic masses of its two stable isotopes, \\(\\ce{^{63}_{29}Cu}\\) (69.09%) and \\(\\ce{^{65}_{29}Cu}\\) (30.91%), are 62.93 amu and 64.9278 amu, respectively. What is the average atomic mass?\nAnswer: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& 62.93\\,\\text{amu}\\times69.09\\%+64.9278\\,\\text{amu}\\times30.91\\% \\\\\n= & 63.55\\,\\text{amu}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 12.00 grams of \\(\\ce{^{12}C}\\).\n\\[1\\,\\text{mol} = N_A = 6.0221415\\times10^{23}\\]\n\\(N_A\\) is Avogadro’s number.\nMolar mass is the mass of 1 mole of something in grams. For any element, the atomic mass (amu) equals to the molar mass (grams).\n\nExample: How many grams of Zn are in 0.356 mole of Zn?\nAnswer: \n\\[0.356\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\ce{Zn}\\times\\frac{65.39\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{Zn}}{1\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\ce{Zn}} = 23.3\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{Zn}\\]\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts: atomic mass, average atomic mass and molar mass. Understand the defination of mole.\n\nLearn how to calculate the mass of element (\\(m\\)), number of moles of element (\\(n\\)) and number of atoms of element (\\(N\\)). Know one of the values, calculate the other two.\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Molecular Mass\nMolecular mass (also known as molecular weight) is the sum of the atomic masses (in amu) in a molecule.\nThe molar mass (grams) of a molecule equals to the molecular mass (amu).\n\nExample:  The molecular mass of \\(\\ce{H2O}\\).\n\\[(1.008\\,\\text{amu})\\times2+16.00\\,\\text{amu} = 18.02\\,\\text{amu}\\]\nHow many moles of \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) are present in 6.07 g of \\(\\ce{CH4}\\)? \nAnswer: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{molar mass of }\\,\\ce{CH4} \\\\\n= & 12.01\\,\\text{g}+4\\times(1.008\\,\\text{g}) \\\\\n= & 16.04\\,\\text{g}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\\[6.07\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{CH4}\\times\\frac{1\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\ce{CH4}}{16.04\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{CH4}}=0.378\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\ce{CH4}\\]\n\n\n\n1.3. Formular Mass\nFormula mass is the sum of the atomic masses (in amu) in the chemical formula of the substance.\nFormula mass and molecular mass are the same for molecular compounds. But for ionic compounds, there is no molecular mass, but only formula mass.\nThe molar mass (grams) of any ionic compound equals to the formula mass (amu).\n\nExample:  Calculate the formula mass of \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\). \nAnswer:  The atomic mass of Na is 22.99 amu, Cl is 35.45 amu.\nThe formula mass of NaCl is: \\[1\\times22.99\\,\\text{amu} + 1\\times35.45\\,\\text{amu} = 58.44\\,\\text{amu}\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4. Percent Composition\nPercent composition is the percent by mass of each element present in a compound.\nWater, \\(\\ce{H2O}\\), is the first example. One mole of water is \\(18.0152\\,\\text{grams}\\). In that compound, there are two moles of \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms and \\(2\\times1.008 = 2.016\\,\\text{grams}\\). That’s how many grams of hydrogen are present in one mole of water.\nThere is also one mole of oxygen atoms weighing \\(16.00\\,\\text{grams}\\) in the mole of water.\nTo get the percentage of hydrogen, divide the \\(2.016\\) by \\(18.015\\) and multiply by \\(100\\), giving \\(11.19\\%\\).\nFor oxygen it is \\(16.00 \\div 18.015 = 88.81\\%\\).\nNotice that you can also minus hydrogen’s percentage from \\(100\\%\\). So, for oxygen it is \\(100\\% - 11.19\\%= 88.81\\%\\).\n\nExperimental Determination of Empirical Formulas\n\nExample:  Combustion experiment of ethanol. Combust \\(11.5\\,\\text{g}\\) ethanol, get \\(22.0\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{CO2}\\) and \\(13.5\\,\\text{g}\\,\\ce{H2O}\\).

The empirical formula of ethanol is \\(\\ce{C2H6O}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5. Mass Spectrometer\n(Just to have a brief idea about this analytical method)\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. In simpler terms, a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample.\n\nRequirements\n\nLearn how to calculate molar mass, molecular mass and formula mass of molecular and/or ionic compounds.\n\nLearn how to calculate the percent composition of a compound.\n\nLearn how to determine empirical formula from combustion experiment."

    "text": "4. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions\nRedox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process.\n\nOxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n\nReduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this example, \\(\\ce{Na}\\) loses one electron becoming \\(\\ce{Na+}\\). We call this process the oxidation of \\(\\ce{Na}\\). Simultaneously, \\(\\ce{F}\\) gains one electron becoming \\(\\ce{F-}\\). This process is called the reduction of \\(\\ce{F}\\).\nReducing agent is an element or compound that loses (or “donates”) an electron to another chemical species in a redox chemical reaction. Since the reducing agent is losing electrons, it is said to have been oxidized.\nOxidizing agent is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to lose electrons). In a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent itself is reduced.\n\nOxidation Number\nThe oxidation state, often called the oxidation number, is an indicator of the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state, which may be positive, negative or zero, is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic, with no covalent component.\n\nThe oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero.\n\nFor a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion.\n\nHydrogen has an oxidation state of \\(+1\\) and oxygen has an oxidation state of \\(−2\\) when they are present in most compounds. Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of \\(−1\\) in hydrides of active metals, e.g. \\(\\ce{LiH}\\), and oxygen has an oxidation state of \\(−1\\) in peroxides, e.g. \\(\\ce{H2O2}\\).\n\nGroup IA metals have oxidation states of \\(+1\\); IIA metals have \\(+2\\). Fluorine always has an oxidation state of \\(-1\\).\n\nThe algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion.\n\nOxidation numbers do not have to be integers. The oxidation number of oxygen in the superoxide ion, \\(\\ce{O2^-}\\), is \\(-1/2\\).\n\nThe oxidation numbers of elements in their compounds (upper right corner of each element):\n\n\n\nTypes of redox reactions\nCombination Reaction\nCombination is a reaction where two or more elements or compounds (reactants) combine to form a single compound (product).\nExample\n\\[\\ce{2Al + 3Br2 -> 2AlBr3}\\]\nDecomposition Reaction\nDecomposition means the separation of a single chemical compound into its two or more elemental parts or to simpler compounds.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{2KClO3 -> 2KCl + 3O2}\\]\nCombustion Reaction\nCombustion reactions always involve molecular oxygen \\(\\ce{O2}\\). Anytime anything burns (in the usual sense), it is a combustion reaction.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O}\\]\nDisplacement Reaction\nHydrogen Displacement Reaction\nMetals react with water or acid to produce hydrogen.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2}\\]\nThe Activity series for metals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal\nActivity\n\n\n\n\nLi, K, Ba, Ca, Na\nReact with cold water to produce \\(\\ce{H2}\\).\n\n\nMg, Al, Zn, Cr, Fe, Cd\nReact with steam to produce \\(\\ce{H2}\\).\n\n\nCo, Ni, Sn, Pb\nReact with acids to produce \\(\\ce{H2}\\).\n\n\nCu, Ag, Hg, Pt, Au\nDo not react with water or acids to produce \\(\\ce{H2}\\).\n\n\n\nMetal Displacement Reaction\nMore active metals displace less active metals.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{TiCl4 + 2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl2}\\]\nHalogen Displacement Reaction\nMore active halogen produces less active halogen\n\\[\\ce{F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2}\\]\nExample\n\\[\\ce{Cl2 + 2KBr -> 2KCl + Br2}\\]\nDisproportionation Reaction\nThe same element is simultaneously oxidized and reduced.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{Cl2 + 2OH- -> ClO- + Cl- + H2O}\\]\n\nExample:  Classify the following redox reactions and indicate changes in the oxidation numbers of the elements. \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{(a)}\\,\\ce{2N2O(g) -> 2N2(g) + O2(g)} \\\\\n& \\text{(b)}\\,\\ce{6Li(s) + N2(g) -> 2Li3N(s)} \\\\\n& \\text{(c)}\\,\\ce{Ni(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) \\\\\n& -> Pb(s) + Ni(NO3)2(aq)}\n\\end{align*}\\] \nAnswer: \n\nDecomposition reaction. The products, \\(\\ce{N2}\\) and \\(\\ce{O2}\\), are free elements. The oxdation numbers must be 0. In the reactant, O has an oxidation number of \\(-2\\) according to the rule, N must be \\(+1\\).\nCombination reaction. The reactants, \\(\\ce{Li}\\) and \\(\\ce{N2}\\), are free elements. The oxdation numbers must be 0. In the product, Li has an oxidation number of \\(+1\\) according to the rule, N must be \\(-3\\).\nMetal displacement reaction. \\(\\ce{NO3-}\\) anion does not change in this reaction. According to the rule, O has an oxidation number of \\(-2\\), thus N must be \\(+5\\). In the reactants, Ni as free element has an oxidation number 0, Pb must be \\(+2\\) to make \\(\\ce{Pb(NO3)2}\\) neutral. In the products, Pb as free element has an oxidation number 0, Ni must be \\(+2\\) to make \\(\\ce{Pb(NO3)2}\\) neutral.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand and remember the concepts.\n\nKnow how to determine oxidation numbers.\n\nRemember the relative activities of metals. Alkali metals plus Ca, Ba are very active and can react with cool water. Mg, Al, Zn, Fe can react with steam. Ni and Pb only react with acid. Cu, Ag, Hg, Au, Pt do not react with acid to produce hydrogen.\n\nRemember at lease one example of each type of redox reactions."

    "text": "4. The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases\nEnergy is defined as the capacity to do work or to produce change. In mechanics, work is defined as force times distance. Because energy can be measured as work, we can write\n\\[\\text{energy}=\\text{word done}=\\text{force}\\times\\text{distance}\\]\nThe SI unit of energy is joule (J)\n\\[1\\,\\text{J} = 1\\,\\text{kg m}^2\\text{/s}^2 = 1\\,\\text{N m}\\]\nKinetic energy (KE) is the type of energy expended by a moving object, or energy of motion.\nThe assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases\n\nA gas is composed of molecules that are separated from each other by distances far greater than their own dimensions. The molecules can be considered to be points; that is, they possess mass but have negligible volume.\n\nGas molecules are in constant motion in random directions, and they frequently collide with one another. Collisions among molecules are perfectly elastic.\n\nGas molecules exert neither attractive nor repulsive forces on one another.\n\nThe average kinetic energy of the molecules is proportional to the temperature of the gas in kelvins. Any two gases at the same temperature will have the same average kinetic energy\n\n\\[\\overline{KE}=\\frac{1}{2}m\\overline{u^2}\\propto T\\]\nAn elastic collision is an encounter between two bodies in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies after the encounter is equal to their total kinetic energy before the encounter.\nExplanation of the gas laws\n\nCompressibility of Gases. Because molecules in the gas phase are separated by large distances (assumption 1), gases can be compressed easily to occupy less volume.\n\nBoyle’s Law. The pressure exerted by a gas results from the impact of its molecules on the walls of the container. The collision rate, or the number of molecular collisions with the walls per second, is proportional to the number density (that is, number of molecules per unit volume) of the gas. Decreasing the volume of a given amount of gas increases its number density and hence its collision rate. For this reason, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies; as volume decreases, pressure increases and vice versa.\n\nCharles’s Law. Because the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to the sample’s absolute temperature (assumption 4), raising the temperature increases the average kinetic energy. Consequently, molecules will collide with the walls of the container more frequently and with greater impact if the gas is heated, and thus the pressure increases. The volume of gas will expand until the gas pressure is balanced by the constant external pressure.\n\nAvogadro’s Law. For two gases under the same conditions of pressure, volume, and temperature (that is, when \\(P_1 = P_2\\), \\(T_1 = T_2\\), and \\(V_1 = V_2\\)), it follows that \\(n_1 = n_2\\), which is a mathematical expression of Avogadro’s law.\n\nDalton’s Law of Partial Pressures. If molecules do not attract or repel one another (assumption 3), then the pressure exerted by one type of molecule is unaffected by the presence of another gas. Consequently, the total pressure is given by the sum of individual gas pressures.\n\n\nRoot-Mean-Square Speed\n\\[u_{rms}=\\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}{\\mathcal{M}}}\\]\nwhere \\(u_{rms}\\)is the root-mean-square speed which is an average molecular speed.\n\n\nGas diffusion\nGas diffusion is the gradual mixing of molecules of one gas with molecules of another by virtue of their kinetic properties.\n\n\nGas effusion\nGas effusion is the process by which gas under pressure escapes from one compartment of a container to another by passing through a small opening.\nIn both diffusion and effusion the correlations among rate, time and molar mass are:\n\\[\\frac{r_1}{r_2}=\\frac{t_2}{t_1}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{M}_2}{\\mathcal{M}_1}}\\]\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts and explanations of the kinetic molecular theory.\n\nUnderstand the square root rule. If the gas molecule is 100 times heavier, the average speed would reduce to 1/10."

Bohr’s Theory\nFor a hydrogen atom\n\nBohr postulated that the electron is allowed to occupy only certain orbits of specific energies.\n\nAn electron in any of the allowed orbits will not radiate energy.\n\nElectron dropping from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one and giving up a quantum of energy (a photon) in the form of light.\n\nEnergies that an electron in hydrogen atom can occupy are given by\n\\[E_n = -R_H\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\\]\nWhen \\(n = 1\\), we call this the ground state, or the ground level, which refers to the lowest energy state of a system.\nThe stability of the electron diminishes for \\(n = 2, 3,\\) …. Each of these levels is called an excited state, or excited level, which is higher in energy than the ground state.\nThe transition of a hydrogen atom from an excited level to another level with lower energy results in the emission of a photon of frequency \\(\\nu\\) and energy \\(h\\nu\\), we can write\n\\[\\Delta E = h\\nu = R_H\\left(\\frac{1}{n_i^2}-\\frac{1}{n_f^2}\\right)\\]\nWhen \\(n_i > n_f\\), a photon is emmitted; otherwise a photon is absopted with a negtive \\(\\Delta E\\) value.\nSince \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_f\\) can be any values, the possible emission photon frequencies could be many. The sum of all these emissions give the atomic emission spectra.\nEmission spectra is either continuous or line spectra of radiation emitted by substances.\nLine spectra are the light emission only at specific wavelengths. Atomic emission spectra are line spectra.\n\nExample: What is the wavelength of a photon (in nanometers) emitted during a transition from the ni = 5 state to the nf = 2 state in the hydrogen atom? \nAnswer:  \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta E & = R_\\text{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_i^2} - \\frac{1}{n_f^2}\\right) \\\\\n& = 2.18\\times10^{-18}\\,\\text{J}\\times\\left(\\frac{1}{5^2}-\\frac{1}{2^2} \\right) \\\\\n& = -4.58\\times10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}\n\\end{align*}\\] The negative sign indicates that this is an emission process.

The Dual Nature of the Electron\n\nAn electron can be considered as a kind of wave.\n\nThe wavelength of an electron can be calculated as\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mu}\\]\n\nExample: Calculate the wavelength of an electron moving at 68 m/s. The mass of an electron is \\(9.11\\times10^{-31}\\) kg. \nAnswer: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda & = \\frac{h}{mu} \\\\\n& = \\frac{6.63\\times10^{-34}\\,\\text{J s}}{9.11\\times10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}\\times 68\\,\\text{m/s}} \\\\\n& = 1.1\\times10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nAccording to de Broglie, an electron bound to the nucleus behaves like a standing wave.\nThe waves are described as standing, or stationary, because they do not travel along the string. Some points on the string, called nodes, do not move at all; that is, the amplitude of the wave at these points is zero. There is a node at each end, and there may be nodes between the ends. The greater the frequency of vibration, the shorter the wavelength of the standing wave and the greater the number of nodes.\n\nThe relation between the circumference of an allowed orbit (\\(2\\pi r\\)) and the wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the electron is given by\n\\[2\\pi r = n\\lambda\\]\nwhich means the circumference must equal to whold number of wavelengths.\n\n\n2.3. Quantum Mechanics\nTo fully understand the structure of atoms, quantum mechanics is needed.\nSchrödinger equation is the fundmental equation in quantum mechanics, by solving which one can get a wave function to describe the whole system.\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle: It is impossible to know simultaneously both the momentum (mass times velocity) and the position of a particle with certainty.\nAlthough quantum mechanics tells us that we cannot pinpoint an electron in an atom, it does define the region where the electron might be at a given time. The concept of electron density gives the probability that an electron will be found in a particular region of an atom. The square of the wave function, \\(\\psi^2\\), defines the distribution of electron density in three-dimensional space around the nucleus. Regions of high electron density represent a high probability of locating the electron, whereas the opposite holds for regions of low electron density.\nAn atomic orbital can be thought of as the wave function of an electron in an atom. When we say that an electron is in a certain orbital, we mean that the distribution of the electron density or the probability of locating the electron in space is described by the square of the wave function associated with that orbital. An atomic orbital, therefore, has a characteristic energy, as well as a characteristic distribution of electron density.\nPauli exclusion principle: no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand Bohr’s theory and atomic emission spectra.\n\nRemember the relation between the circumference of an allowed orbit and the wavelength of the electron.\n\nBe familiar with the concepts in quantum mechanics."

The value of \\(n\\) determines the energy of an orbital. The principal quantum number also relates to the average distance of the electron from the nucleus in a particular orbital.

Thus, the order goes as follows: \\(1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < ….\\)\n\n\nExample: Write the four quantum numbers (all possible combinations) for an electron in a \\(3p\\) orbital. \nAnswer:  In the \\(3p\\) orbital, the main quantum number \\(n=3\\), the angular quantum number \\(l=1\\), the magnetic auantum number \\(m_l\\) could be 0 and \\(\\pm 1\\).

Be familiar with \\(s, p, d\\) orbitals.\n\nRemember the order in which atomic subshells are filled in a many-electron atom.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Electron Configuration\nThe four quantum numbers \\(n\\), \\(l\\), \\(m_l\\), and \\(m_s\\) enable us to label completely an electron in any orbital in any atom. In a sense, we can regard the set of four quantum numbers as the “address” of an electron in an atom, somewhat in the same way that a street address, city, state, and postal ZIP code specify the address of an individual.\nExample. Write the four quantum numbers for an electron in a \\(3p\\) orbital.\nIn \\(3p\\) orbital, the principle quantum number \\(n = 3\\), the angular momentum Quantum number \\(l = 1\\), the magnetic quantum number could be \\(m_l = -1, 0, +1\\), the electron spin quantum number could be \\(m_s = -1, +1\\). So, all possibilities are:\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\(l\\)\n\\(m_l\\)\n\\(m_s\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(-1\\)\n\\(+1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(-1\\)\n\\(-1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(+1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(-1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(+1/2\\)\n\n\n\\(3\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(-1/2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nH\nElectron configuration of hydrogen atom:\n\nThe electron in a ground-state hydrogen atom must be in the \\(1s\\) orbital.\n\n\nHe\nThere are two electrons in a helium atom. The ground-state electron configuration is \\(1s^2\\). Both electrons are in the \\(1s\\) orbital. However, according to Pauli exclusion principle, the four quantum numbers should not be the same. Thus, in helium, \\(m_s = +1/2\\) for one electron; \\(m_s = -1/2\\) for the other. Electrons that have opposite spins are said to be paired.\n\nParamagnetic substances are those that contain net unpaired spins and are attracted by a magnet.\nDiamagnetic substances do not contain net unpaired spins and are slightly repelled by a magnet. He is diamagnetic.\n\n\nLi\nConsider the lithium atom (Z = 3), which has three electrons. The third electron cannot go into the \\(1s\\) orbital because it would inevitably have the same set of four quantum numbers as one of the first two electrons. Therefore, this electron “enters” the next (energetically) higher orbital, which is the \\(2s\\) orbital. The electron configuration is \\(1s^22S^1\\)\n\n\n\nBe\nThe ground-state electron configuration of beryllium is \\(1s^22s^2\\).\n\n\n\nB\nThe ground-state electron configuration of boron is \\(1s^22s^22p^1\\).\n\n\n\nC\nHund’s rule, which states that the most stable arrangement of electrons in subshells is the one with the greatest number of parallel spins. Thus the ground-state electron configuration of carbon is \\(1s^22s^22p^2\\).The two \\(p\\) orbital electrons have different \\(m_l\\) quantum numbers.\n\n\n\nN\nThe ground-state electron configuration of nitrogen is \\(1s^22s^22p^3\\).\n\n\nO\nThe ground-state electron configuration of oxygen is \\(1s^22s^22p^4\\).\n\n\nF\nThe ground-state electron configuration of fluorine is \\(1s^22s^22p^5\\).\n\n\nNe\nThe ground-state electron configuration of neon is \\(1s^22s^22p^6\\).\n\n\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nEach shell or principal level of quantum number \\(n\\) contains \\(n\\) subshells. For example, if \\(n = 2\\), then there are two subshells (two values of \\(l\\)) of angular momentum quantum numbers \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nEach subshell of quantum number \\(l\\) contains (\\(2l + 1\\)) orbitals. For example, if \\(l = 1\\), then there are three \\(p\\) orbitals.\n\nNo more than two electrons can be placed in each orbital. Therefore, the maximum number of electrons is simply twice the number of orbitals that are employed.\n\nA quick way to determine the maximum number of electrons that an atom can have in a principal level \\(n\\) is to use the formula \\(2n^2\\).\n\n\nExample: What is the maximum number of electrons that can be present in the principal level for which \\(n = 3\\)? \nAnswer:  When \\(n=3\\), \\(l\\) could be 0, 1, 2, corresponding to \\(s\\), \\(p\\) and \\(d\\) orbitals.  In \\(s\\) orbital, \\(m_l\\) must be 0. Thus, there is only one \\(s\\) orbital.  When \\(l=1\\), \\(m_l\\) has three possible values (\\(-1\\), 0, \\(=1\\)), thus there are three \\(p\\) orbitals.  When \\(l=2\\), \\(m_l\\) has five possible values (\\(-2\\), \\(-1\\), 0, \\(=1\\), \\(+2\\)), thus there are five \\(d\\) orbitals. \nThe total number of orbitals is \\(1+3+5=9\\). Each orbital can host two electrons with \\(m_s = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\), respectively. Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be present in the principal level \\(n=3\\) is 18.\n\n\nExample: An oxygen atom has a total of eight electrons. Write the four quantum numbers for each of the eight electrons in the ground state. \nAnswer:  (1, 0, \\(0\\), \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (1, 0, \\(0\\), \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 0, \\(0\\), \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 0, \\(0\\), \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 1, \\(-1\\), \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 1, 0, \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 1, \\(+1\\), \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\))  (2, 1, \\(+1\\), \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\))  Of course, the placement of the eighth electron in the orbital labeled \\(m_l = +1\\) is completely arbitrary. It would be equally correct to assign it to \\(m_l = 0\\) or \\(m_l = -1\\).\n\n\nRequirements\n\nRemember everything in this part.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. The Building-Up Principle\nThe Aufbau principle dictates that as protons are added one by one to the nucleus to build up the elements, electrons are similarly added to the atomic orbitals.\nFor example, the electron configuration of argon (\\(Z=18\\)) is \\(1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^6\\). Potassium (\\(Z=19\\)) has one more proton and one more electron than argon. The electron configuration of potassium is \\(1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^1\\). Because \\(3d\\) orbitals have higher energy than \\(4s\\) orbital, the outmost layer electron of potassium goes to \\(4s\\) rather than \\(3d\\). Since the inner layer electron configuration of potassium is the same as argon, the electron configuration of potassium can be written as \\([\\ce{Ar}]4s^1\\) where [Ar] denotes the “argon core.”\nThe electron configurations of all elements except hydrogen and helium are represented by a noble gas core, which shows in brackets the noble gas element that most nearly precedes the element being considered, followed by the symbol for the highest filled subshells in the outermost shells.\nTransition metals either have incompletely filled \\(d\\) subshells or readily give rise to cations that have incompletely filled \\(d\\) subshells.\nConsider the first transition metal series, from scandium through copper. In this series additional electrons are placed in the \\(3d\\) orbitals, according to Hund’s rule. However, there are two irregularities. The electron configuration of chromium (\\(Z = 24\\)) is \\([\\ce{Ar}]4s^13d^5\\) and not \\([\\ce{Ar}]4s^23d^4\\), as we might expect. A similar break in the pattern is observed for copper, whose electron configuration is \\([\\ce{Ar}]4s^13d^{10}\\) rather than \\([\\ce{Ar}]4s^23d^9\\). The reason for these irregularities is that a slightly greater stability is associated with the half-filled (\\(3d^5\\)) and completely filled (\\(3d^{10}\\)) subshells.\nFollowing lanthanum are the 14 elements known as the lanthanides, or rare earth series [cerium (\\(Z = 58\\)) to lutetium (\\(Z = 71\\))]. The rare earth metals have incompletely filled \\(4f\\) subshells or readily give rise to cations that have incompletely filled \\(4f\\) subshells.\nThe last row of elements is the actinide series, which starts at thorium (\\(Z = 90\\)). Most of these elements are not found in nature but have been synthesized.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand how to represent the electron configuration using nobel gas core.\n\nBe familiar with the concepts and examples shown here."

Atomic Radius\nWe define the size of an atom in terms of its atomic radius, which is one-half the distance between the two nuclei in two adjacent metal atoms.

    "text": "4. A Survy of Chemical Properties of Elements\n\n4.1. General Trends\n\nThe same group of elements have the same valence electron configuration; thus, there chemical properties must have something in common.\n\nAnother trend in the chemical behavior of the representative elements is the diagonal relationship. Diagonal relationships are similarities between pairs of elements in different groups and periods of the periodic table. Specifically, the first three members of the second period (Li, Be, and B) exhibit many similarities to those elements located diagonally below them in the periodic table. The reason for this phenomenon is the closeness of the charge densities of their cations.\n\nBear in mind that a comparison of the properties of elements in the same group is most valid if we are dealing with elements of the same type with respect to their metallic character. This guideline applies to the elements in Groups 1A and 2A, which are all metals, and to the elements in Groups 7A and 8A, which are all nonmetals. In Groups 3A through 6A, where the elements change either from nonmetals to metals or from nonmetals to metalloids, it is natural to expect greater variation in chemical properties even though the members of the same group have similar outer electron configurations.\n\n\n4.2. Survy of the Representative Elements\n\nHydrogen\nHydrogen has only one electron. It can lose one electron to form a cation \\(\\ce{H+}\\). For example, \\(\\ce{H}\\) in \\(\\ce{HF}\\), \\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{HBr}\\), etc.\nIt can also gain one extra electron to fill the \\(1s\\) orbital and become \\(\\ce{H-}\\). For example, \\(\\ce{H}\\) in \\(\\ce{NaH}\\), \\(\\ce{KH}\\), \\(\\ce{CaH2}\\), etc.\n\n\nGroup 1A Elements\nAll of these elements, the alkali metals, have low ionization energies and therefore a great tendency to lose the single valence electron. These metals are so reactive that they are never found in the pure state in nature. They react with water to produce hydrogen gas and the corresponding metal hydroxide. When exposed to air, they gradually lose their shiny appearance as they combine with oxygen gas to form oxides.\n\n\nGroup 2A Elements\nThe alkaline earth metals are somewhat less reactive than the alkali metals. They can form \\(\\ce{M^{2+}}\\) ions (where \\(\\ce{M}\\) denotes an alkaline earth metal atom). The metallic character and activity increases from top to bottom.\nBeryllium does not react with water; magnesium reacts slowly with steam; calcium, strontium, and barium are reactive enough to attack cold water.\n\n\nGroup 3A Elements\nThe first member of Group 3A, boron, is a metalloid; the rest are metals. Boron does not form binary ionic compounds and is unreactive toward oxygen gas and water. The next element, aluminum, readily forms aluminum oxide when exposed to air.\nAluminum that has a protective coating of aluminum oxide is less reactive than elemental aluminum. Aluminum forms only tripositive ions.\nThe other Group 3A metallic elements form both unipositive and tripositive ions. Moving down the group, we find that the unipositive ion becomes more stable than the tripositive ion.\nFrom left to right across the periodic table, we are seeing a gradual shift from metallic to nonmetallic character in the representative elements.\n\n\nGroup 4A Elements\nThe first member of Group 4A, carbon, is a nonmetal, and the next two members, silicon and germanium, are metalloids. The metallic elements of this group, tin and lead, do not react with water, but they do react with acids (hydrochloric acid, for example) to liberate hydrogen gas.\nThe Group 4A elements form compounds in both the +2 and +4 oxidation states. For carbon and silicon, the +4 oxidation state is the more stable one.\nIn tin compounds, the +4 oxidation state is only slightly more stable than the +2 oxidation state. In lead compounds, the +2 oxidation state is unquestionably the more stable one.\n\n\nGroup 5A Elements\nNitrogen and phosphorus are nonmetals, arsenic and antimony are metalloids, and bismuth is a metal.\nElemental nitrogen is a diatomic gas (\\(\\ce{N2}\\)). It forms a number of oxides (\\(\\ce{NO}\\), \\(\\ce{N2O}\\), \\(\\ce{NO2}\\), \\(\\ce{N2O4}\\), and \\(\\ce{N2O5}\\)). Nitrogen also has a tendency to accept three electrons to form the nitride ion, \\(\\ce{N^{3−}}\\).\nPhosphorus exists as \\(\\ce{P4}\\) molecules. It forms two solid oxides with the formulas \\(\\ce{P4O6}\\) and \\(\\ce{P4O10}\\). The important oxoacids \\(\\ce{HNO3}\\) and \\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) are formed when the following oxides react with water.\n\n\nGroup 6A Elements\nThe first three members of Group 6A (oxygen, sulfur, and selenium) are nonmetals, and the last two (tellurium and polonium) are metalloids.\nOxygen is a diatomic gas; elemental sulfur and selenium have the molecular formulas \\(\\ce{S8}\\) and \\(\\ce{Se8}\\), respectively.\nOxygen has a tendency to accept two electrons to form the oxide ion (\\(\\ce{O^{2−}}\\)) in many ionic compounds. Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium also form dinegative anions (\\(\\ce{S^{2−}}\\), \\(\\ce{Se^{2−}}\\), and \\(\\ce{Te^{2−}}\\)).\nThe elements in this group (especially oxygen) form a large number of molecular compounds with nonmetals. The important compounds of sulfur are \\(\\ce{SO2}\\), \\(\\ce{SO3}\\), and \\(\\ce{H2S}\\). Sulfuric acid is formed when sulfur trioxide reacts with water.\n\n\nGroup 7A Elements\nAll the halogens are nonmetals with the general formula \\(\\ce{X2}\\), where \\(\\ce{X}\\) denotes a halogen element. Because of their great reactivity, the halogens are never found in the elemental form in nature. Fluorine is so reactive that it attacks water to generate oxygen.\nThe halogens have high ionization energies and large positive electron affinities. Anions derived from the halogens (\\(\\ce{F^{−}}\\), \\(\\ce{Cl^{−}}\\), \\(\\ce{Br^{−}}\\), and \\(\\ce{I^{−}}\\)) are called halides. They are isoelectronic with the noble gases immediately to their right in the periodic table.\nThe vast majority of the alkali metal halides and alkaline earth metal halides are ionic compounds. The halogens also form many molecular compounds among themselves (such as \\(\\ce{ICl}\\) and \\(\\ce{BrF3}\\)) and with nonmetallic elements in other groups (such as \\(\\ce{NF3}\\), \\(\\ce{PCl5}\\), and \\(\\ce{SF6}\\)). The halogens react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides.\nThe hydrogen halides dissolve in water to form hydrohalic acids. Hydrofluoric acid (\\(\\ce{HF}\\)) is a weak acid (that is, it is a weak electrolyte), but the other hydrohalic acids (\\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{HBr}\\), and \\(\\ce{HI}\\)) are all strong acids (strong electrolytes).\n\n\nGroup 8A Elements\nAll noble gases exist as monatomic species. Their atoms have completely filled outer \\(ns\\) and \\(np\\) subshells, which give them great stability. The Group 8A ionization energies are among the highest of all elements, and these gases have no tendency to accept extra electrons. For years these elements were called inert gases, and rightly so.\n\n\n\n4.3. Properties of Oxides Across a Period\nWe observed earlier that oxygen has a tendency to form the oxide ion. This tendency is greatly favored when oxygen combines with metals that have low ionization energies, namely, those in Groups 1A and 2A, plus aluminum. Ionic compounds have high melting points and boiling points.\nAs the ionization energies of the elements increase from left to right, so does the molecular nature of the oxides that are formed. Silicon is a metalloid; its oxide (\\(\\ce{SiO2}\\)) also has a huge three-dimensional network, although no ions are present.\nThe oxides of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine are molecular compounds composed of small discrete units. The weak attractions among these molecules result in relatively low melting points and boiling points.\nMost oxides can be classified as acidic or basic depending on whether they produce acids or bases when dissolved in water or react as acids or bases in certain processes. Some oxides are amphoteric, e.g. \\(\\ce{Al2O3}\\), which means that they display both acidic and basic properties.\nMetal oxides are generally basic because they can react with acid to form salt and water. For example, \\(\\ce{Na2O}\\) and \\(\\ce{MgO}\\)\nNon-metal oxides are generally non-basic. Some of them are acidic bacause they can react with base to form salt and water, e.g. \\(\\ce{SO3}\\), \\(\\ce{Cl2O7}\\), \\(\\ce{SiO2}\\). Some of them are neutral, e.g. \\(\\ce{CO}\\), \\(\\ce{NO}\\).\nAn example of amphoteric oxide is \\(\\ce{Al2O3}\\) which can react with both acids and bases.\n\nRequirements\n\nBe familiar with the general properties of each group.\n\nUnderstand basic and acidic oxides. Remember \\(\\ce{Al2O3}\\) is amphoteric."

    "text": "1. Ionic Bond and Covalent Bond\n\n1.1. Lewis Dot Symbols\nAtoms combine to achieve a more stable electron configuration. Maximum stability results when an atom is isoelectronic with a noble gas.\nValence electrons are the outer shell electrons of an atom. The valence electrons are the electrons that participate in chemical bonding.\nA Lewis dot symbol consists of the symbol of an element and one dot for each valence electron in an atom of the element.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2. The Ionic Bond\nAs a rule, the elements most likely to form cations in ionic compounds are the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, and the elements most likely to form anions are the halogens and oxygen.\nAn ionic bond is the electrostatic force that holds ions together in an ionic compound. The compound itself is electrically neutral.\nExamples (remember to balance the equation):\n\n\n\n1.3. Lattice Energy of Ionic Compounds\nA quantitative measure of the stability of any ionic solid is its lattice energy, defined as the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into gaseous ions.\nThere is a rough correlation between lattice energy and melting point. The larger the lattice energy, the more stable the solid and the more tightly held the ions. It takes more energy to melt such a solid, and so the solid has a higher melting point than one with a smaller lattice energy. Note that \\(\\ce{MgCl2}\\), \\(\\ce{MgO}\\), and \\(\\ce{CaO}\\) have unusually high lattice energies. The first of these ionic compounds has a doubly charged cation (\\(\\ce{Mg^{2+}}\\)) and in the second and third compounds there is an interaction between two doubly charged species (\\(\\ce{Mg^{2+}}\\) or \\(\\ce{Ca^{2+}}\\) and \\(\\ce{O^{2−}}\\)).\n\nThe coulombic attractions between two doubly charged species, or between a doubly charged ion and a singly charged ion, are much stronger than those between singly charged anions and cations.\n\nThe coulombic attractions between smaller ions are stronger than those between larger ions.\n\n\n\n1.4. The Covalent Bond\nCovalent bond is a bond in which two electrons are shared by two atoms. Covalent compounds are compounds that contain only covalent bonds.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the shared pair of electrons is often represented by a single line. Thus, the covalent bond in the hydrogen molecule can be written as \\(\\ce{H-H}\\). In a covalent bond, each electron in a shared pair is attracted to the nuclei of both atoms. This attraction holds the two atoms in \\(\\ce{H2}\\) together and is responsible for the formation of covalent bonds in other molecules.\nlone pairs: pairs of valence electrons that are not involved in covalent bond formation.\nA Lewis structure is a representation of covalent bonding in which shared electron pairs are shown either as lines or as pairs of dots between two atoms, and lone pairs are shown as pairs of dots on individual atoms.\nOctet rule: An atom other than hydrogen tends to form bonds until it is surrounded by eight valence electrons.\nA single bond, two atoms are held together by one electron pair. If two atoms share two pairs of electrons, the covalent bond is called a double bond. A triple bond arises when two atoms share three pairs of electrons, as in the nitrogen molecule (\\(\\ce{N2}\\)).\nFor the same pair of atoms, multiple bonds are shorter than single covalent bonds. Bond length is defined as the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms in a molecule. Generally, shorter means stronger.\n\n\n1.5. Electronegativity\nIn a Polar covalent bond, or simply a polar bond, the electrons spend more time in the vicinity of one atom than the other.\nElectronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract toward itself the electrons in a chemical bond.\nElectronegativity is related to electron affinity and ionization energy. Thus, an atom such as fluorine, which has a high electron affinity (tends to pick up electrons easily) and a high ionization energy (does not lose electrons easily), has a high electronegativity. On the other hand, sodium has a low electron affinity, a low ionization energy, and a low electronegativity.\nIn general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table, as the metallic character of the elements decreases. Within each group, electronegativity decreases with increasing atomic number, and increasing metallic character.\n\nAn ionic bond forms when the electronegativity difference between the two bonding atoms is 2.0 or more. This rule applies to most but not all ionic compounds.\n\nA polar covalent bond forms when the electronegativity difference between the atoms is in the range of 0.3–2.0.\n\nIf the electronegativity difference is below 0.3, the bond is normally classified as a covalent bond, with little or no polarity.\n\nElectronegativity and electron affinity are related but different concepts. Both indicate the tendency of an atom to attract electrons. However, electron affinity refers to an isolated atom’s attraction for an additional electron, whereas electronegativity signifies the ability of an atom in a chemical bond (with another atom) to attract the shared electrons.\nOxidation number refers to the number of charges an atom would have if electrons were transferred completely to the more electronegative of the bonded atoms in a molecule.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts\n\nUnderstand how to distinguish ionic band and covalent bond based on the electronegtivities."

The Concept of Resonance\nA resonance structure is one of two or more Lewis structures for a single molecule that cannot be represented accurately by only one Lewis structure.\nThe term resonance itself means the use of two or more Lewis structures to represent a particular molecule.\nA common misconception about resonance is the notion that a molecule such as ozone somehow shifts quickly back and forth from one resonance structure to the other. Keep in mind that neither resonance structure adequately represents the actual molecule, which has its own unique, stable structure. “Resonance” is a human invention, designed to address the limitations in these simple bonding models.\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand what is resonance structure and remember the examples.\n\n\n\n\n2.4. Exceptions to the Octet Rule\nThe octet rule applies mainly to the second-period elements. Exceptions to the octet rule fall into three categories characterized by an incomplete octet, an odd number of electrons, or more than eight valence electrons around the central atom.\n\nThe Incomplete Octet\nIn some compounds, the number of electrons surrounding the central atom in a stable molecule is fewer than eight. Consider, for example, beryllium, and boron.\nExample, in boron trifluoride there are only six electrons around the boron atom\n\nAlthough boron trifluoride is stable, it readily reacts with ammonia.\n\nThe bond between \\(\\ce{N}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\) is called a coordinate covalent bond, defined as a covalent bond in which one of the atoms donates both electrons.\n\n\nOdd-Electron Molecules\nSome molecules contain an odd number of electrons. Among them are nitric oxide (\\(\\ce{NO}\\)) and nitrogen dioxide (\\(\\ce{NO2}\\)).\n\nOdd-electron molecules are sometimes called radicals. Many radicals are highly reactive. For example, when two nitrogen dioxide molecules collide, they can form dinitrogen tetroxide in which the octet rule is satisfied for both the N and O atoms:\n\n\nThe Expanded Octet\nAtoms of the second-period elements cannot have more than eight valence electrons around the central atom, but atoms of elements in and beyond the third period of the periodic table form some compounds in which more than eight electrons surround the central atom. In addition to the \\(3s\\) and \\(3p\\) orbitals, elements in the third period also have \\(3d\\) orbitals that can be used in bonding. These orbitals enable an atom to form an expanded octet.\nOne compound in which there is an expanded octet is sulfur hexafluoride, a very stable compound. The electron configuration of sulfur is \\([\\ce{Ne}]3s^23p^4\\). In \\(\\ce{SF6}\\), each of sulfur’s six valence electrons forms a covalent bond with a fluorine atom, so there are twelve electrons around the central sulfur atom:\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts.\n\nRemember the examples."

    "section": "3. Valence Bond Theory",
    "text": "3. Valence Bond Theory\n\nBasic Concepts\nValence bond (VB) theory assumes that the electrons in a molecule occupy atomic orbitals of the individual atoms.\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory, assumes the formation of molecular orbitals from the atomic orbitals.\nValence bond theory: When the two atoms are far apart, there is no interaction. We say that the potential energy of this system (that is, the two H atoms) is zero. As the atoms approach each other, each electron is attracted by the nucleus of the other atom; at the same time, the electrons repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still separated, attraction is stronger than repulsion, so that the potential energy of the system decreases (that is, it becomes negative) as the atoms approach each other. This trend continues until the potential energy reaches a minimum value. At this point, when the system has the lowest potential energy, it is most stable. This condition corresponds to substantial overlap of the \\(1s\\) orbitals and the formation of a stable \\(\\ce{H2}\\) molecule. If the distance between nuclei were to decrease further, the potential energy would rise steeply and finally become positive as a result of the increased electron-electron and nuclear-nuclear repulsions. In accord with the law of conservation of energy, the decrease in potential energy as a result of \\(\\ce{H2}\\) formation must be accompanied by a release of energy. The converse is also true. To break a \\(\\ce{H-H}\\) bond, energy must be supplied to the molecule.\nThe concept of overlapping atomic orbitals applies equally well to diatomic molecules other than \\(\\ce{H2}\\). Thus, a stable \\(\\ce{F2}\\) molecule forms when the \\(2p\\) orbitals (containing the unpaired electrons) in the two \\(\\ce{F}\\) atoms overlap to form a covalent bond. Similarly, the formation of the \\(\\ce{HF}\\) molecule can be explained by the overlap of the \\(1s\\) orbital in \\(\\ce{H}\\) with the \\(2p\\) orbital in \\(\\ce{F}\\). In each case, valence bond theory accounts for the changes in potential energy as the distance between the reacting atoms changes. Because the orbitals involved are not the same kind in all cases, we can see why the bond enthalpies and bond lengths in \\(\\ce{H2}\\), \\(\\ce{F2}\\), and \\(\\ce{HF}\\) might be different.\n\n\n3.2. Hybridization of Atomic Orbitals\nHybrid orbitals are atomic orbitals obtained when two or more nonequivalent orbitals of the same atom combine in preparation for covalent bond formation. Hybridization is the term applied to the mixing of atomic orbitals in an atom (usually a central atom) to generate a set of hybrid orbitals.\n\n\\(sp^3\\) hybridization.\nExample \\(\\ce{CH4}\\).\nC has a pair of \\(2s\\) electrons and two unpaired \\(2p\\) electrons.\nWhen forming coumponds with 4 single bonds, one of the \\(2s\\) electron would be promoted to the empty \\(2p\\) orbital.\nThen, the \\(2s\\) and \\(2p\\) orbitals mix to four identical \\(sp^3\\) orbitals. By accepting four other electrons from other atoms, four identical single bonds would be formed.\n\n\nExample \\(\\ce{NH3}\\)\n\n\n\\(sp\\) hybridization.\nExample \\(\\ce{BeCl2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(sp^2\\) hybridization\nExample \\(\\ce{BF3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Hybridization in Molecules Containing Double and Triple Bonds\nExample \\(\\ce{CH2=CH2}\\)\nWe assume that only the \\(2p_x\\) and \\(2p_y\\) orbitals combine with the \\(2s\\) orbital, and that the \\(2p_z\\) orbital remains unchanged. Each carbon atom uses the three \\(sp^2\\) hybrid orbitals to form two bonds with the two hydrogen \\(1s\\) orbitals and one bond with the \\(sp^2\\) hybrid orbital of the adjacent C atom. In addition, the two unhybridized \\(2p_z\\) orbitals of the C atoms form another bond by overlapping sideways.\n\n\nThe three bonds formed by each C atom are all sigma bonds (\\(\\sigma\\) bonds), covalent bonds formed by orbitals overlapping end-to-end, with the electron density concentrated between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. The second type is called a pi bond (\\(\\pi\\) bond), which is defined as a covalent bond formed by sideways overlapping orbitals with electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms.\nExample \\(\\ce{CH#CH}\\)\nEach C atom is \\(sp\\)-hybridized by mixing the \\(2s\\) with the \\(2p_x\\) orbital. The two \\(sp\\) hybrid orbitals of each C atom form one \\(\\sigma\\) bond with a hydrogen \\(1s\\) orbital and another \\(\\sigma\\) bond with the other C atom. In addition, two \\(\\pi\\) bonds are formed by the sideways overlap of the unhybridized \\(2p_y\\) and \\(2p_z\\) orbitals. Thus, the \\(\\ce{C#C}\\) bond is made up of one \\(\\sigma\\) bond and two \\(\\pi\\) bonds.\n\n\nThe following rule helps us predict hybridization in molecules containing multiple bonds: If the central atom forms a double bond, it is \\(sp^2\\)-hybridized; if it forms two double bonds or a triple bond, it is \\(sp\\)-hybridized. Note that this rule applies only to atoms of the second-period elements.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand valence bond theory.\n\nRemember examples of \\(sp\\), \\(sp^2\\), \\(sp^3\\) hybridization.\n\nPay attention on \\(\\ce{CH4}\\), \\(\\ce{CH2=CH2}\\), \\(\\ce{CH#CH}\\). Understand \\(\\sigma\\) bonds and \\(\\pi\\) bonds."

    "text": "1. Intermolecular Forces\nIntermolecular forces are attractive forces between molecules, also known as Van der Waals forces.\nIntramolecular forces hold atoms together in a molecule, such as covalent bonds.\n\nInteractions Between Polar Molecules\nPolar covalent bonds are covalent bonds between different atoms.\nA polar molecule has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically.\nExamples: \\(\\ce{HF}\\), \\(\\ce{H2O}\\)\nA non-polar molecule does not have net dipole either becaue there is no polar bond or because the polar bonds cancel each other.\nExamples: \\(\\ce{H2}\\), \\(\\ce{O2}\\) which do not have polar bonds; \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\) in which all polar bonds arranged symmetrically and cancel each other.\nDipole-Dipole Forces are attractive forces between polar molecules.\n\n\nInteractions Involves Non-Polar Molecules\nDispersion Forces are attractive forces that arise as a result of temporary dipoles induced in atoms or molecules.\nPolarizability is the ease with which the electron distribution in the atom or molecule can be distorted. Polarizability increases with: greater number of electrons, and more diffuse electron cloud.\nThe dipole in the atom (or nonpolar molecule) is said to be an induced dipole because the separation of positive and negative charges in the atom (or nonpolar molecule) is due to the proximity of an ion or a polar molecule.\nA nonpolar molecule interact with a polar molecule or an ion because of the induced dipole moment.\nAn atom or a molecule can have all, most or majority of its electrons shifted to one side by random chance of the electron movements. When this happens a temporary dipole is created causing the side with more concentration of electrons to become more electronegative and the opposite relatively electropositive. This is called an instantaneous dipole.\nNonpolar molecules interact with each other due to the fact of the presence of instantaneous dipoles. This kind of interaction is called London dispersion force.\n\n\nSpecial Cases\nIon-Dipole Forces are attractive forces between an ion and a polar molecule.\nHydrogen Bonds is a kind of special dipole-dipole interaction. A hydrogen bond is the electrostatic attraction between two polar groups that occurs when a hydrogen (\\(\\ce{H}\\)) atom covalently bound to a highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen (\\(\\ce{N}\\)), oxygen (\\(\\ce{O}\\)), or fluorine (\\(\\ce{F}\\)) experiences the electrostatic field of another highly electronegative atom nearby.\nGeneral Trend:\nIon-Dipole > Hydrogen bond > Dipole-Dipole > Ion-Induced Diploe > Dipole-Induced Dipole > London Dispersion Force\n\nRequirements\n\nGiven a molecule, draw its 3D geometry and tell if it is polar or nonpolar.\nTell what kind of intermolecular force(s) a molecule has.\nCompare the relative strength of intermolecular forces for given molecules.\nDistinguish hydrogen bonds based on the molecular structures."

    "text": "4.Phase Changes and Diagrams\nA Phase is a homogeneous part of the system in contact with other parts of the system but separated from them by a well-defined boundary.\nPhase Changes are transformations from one phase to another, occur when energy (usually in the form of heat) is added or removed from a substance.\n\nLiquid-Vapor Equilibrium\nAt any given temperature, a certain number of the molecules in a liquid possess sufficient kinetic energy to escape from the surface. This process is called evaporation, or vaporization.\nAs the concentration of molecules in the vapor phase increases, some molecules return to the liquid phase, a process called condensation.\nThe rate of evaporation is constant at any given temperature, and the rate of condensation increases with increasing concentration of molecules in the vapor phase. A state of dynamic equilibrium, in which the rate of a forward process is exactly balanced by the rate of the reverse process, is reached when the rates of condensation and evaporation become equal.\nThe vapor pressure measured under dynamic equilibrium of condensation and evaporation is called the equilibrium vapor pressure.\nMolar heat of vaporization (\\(\\Delta H_\\text{vap}\\)), defined as the energy required to vaporize one mole of a liquid, is a measure of how strongly molecules are held in a liquid is.\nClausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\\[\\ln P = -\\frac{\\Delta H_\\text{vap}}{RT} + C\\]\n\\[\\ln \\frac{P_1}{P_2}=\\frac{\\Delta H_\\text{vap}}{R}\\left(\\frac{T_1-T_2}{T_1T_2}\\right)\\]\nCritical Temperature is the temperature above which the gas cannot be made liquefy, no matter how great the applied pressure.\nCritical Pressure is the minimum pressure that must be applied to bring about liquefaction at the critical temprature.\n\nExample: Knowing the molar heat of vaporization of water (40.66 kJ/mol), calculate the amount of heat absorbed when boiling 10.0 g of water.\nAnswer\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    & 10.0\\text{ g }\\ce{H2O}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ mol}}{18.0\\text{ g}}=0.556\\text{ mol }\\ce{H2O} \\\\\n    & 0.556\\text{ mol}\\times 40.66\\text{ kJ/mol}=22.6\\text{ kJ}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: Diethyl ether, \\(\\ce{CH3CH2OCH2CH3}\\) is a volatile, highly ammable organic liquid that is used mainly as a solvent.

The melting point of a solid (or the freezing point of a liquid) is the temperature at which solid and liquid phases coexist in equilibrium. The normal melting point(or the normal freezing point) of a substance is the melting point (or freezing point) measured at 1 atm pressure. We generally omit the word “normal” in referring to the melting point of a substance at 1 atm.\nMolar Heat of Fusion (\\(\\Delta H_\\text{fus}\\)) is the energy required to melt 1 mole of a solid substance at its freezing point.\n\n\nSolid-Vapor Equilibrium\nMolar Heat of Sublimation (\\(\\Delta H_\\text{sub}\\)) is the energy required to sublime 1 mole of a solid.\nHess’s Law:\n\\[\\Delta H_\\text{sub} = \\Delta H_\\text{fus} + \\Delta H_\\text{vap}\\]\n\n\nPhase Diagrams\nA phase diagram summarizes the conditions under which a substance exists as a solid, liquid, or gas.\nThe point at which all three curves meet is called the triple point. This is the only temperature and pressure at which all three phases can be in equilibrium with one another.\nBoundary lines denote co-existence of two phases.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nRemember the general property differences of gases, liquids and solids.\nUnderstand the concepts.\nDo calculations with Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\nLearn to interpret phase diagrams."

    "section": "1. Some General Concepts and Rules",
    "text": "1. Some General Concepts and Rules\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. There are six types of solutions. (Table 11.1 in OpenStax textbook) A solute is the minor component in a solution, dissolved in the solvent.\nA solvent is a substance that dissolves a solute (a chemically different liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution.\nA saturated solution contains the maximum amount of a solute that will dissolve in a given solvent at a specific temperature.\nAn unsaturated solution contains less solute than the solvent has the capacity to dissolve at a specific temperature.\nA supersaturated solution contains more solute than is present in a saturated solution at a specific temperature. Supersaturation is achieved by dissolving a solute in one set of conditions, then transferring it to other conditions without triggering any release of the solute. Supersaturated solutions are extremely unstable, but often require a triggering event to begin returning to a stable state via the solute coming out of solution.\nMolecular view of solution formation The formation of a solution involves the breaking of solvent-solvent interaction; the breaking of solute-solute interaction; and the formation of solvent-solute interaction.\nexothermic If the solute-solvent attraction is stronger than the solvent-solvent attraction and solute-solute attraction, the solution process is favorable; that is, it is exothermic (\\(\\Delta H_{soln} < 0\\)).\nendothermic If the solute-solvent interaction is weaker than the solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions, the solution process is endothermic (\\(\\Delta H_{soln} > 0\\)). Some endothermic processes still can happen because the formation of solution increases disorder.\nWhen the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.\nSolubility is a measure of the amount of a solute that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature.\nMiscible: When two liquids are completely soluble in each other in all proportions, as in this case, they are said to be miscible. Example, methanol & water.\nSolvation is the process in which an ion or a molecule is surrounded by solvent molecules arranged in a specific manner. When the solvent is water, the process is called hydration.)\nLike dissolves like: Two substances with similar intermolecular forces are likely to be soluble in each other.\n\nNon-polar molecules are soluble in non-polar solvents\nPolar molecules are soluble in polar solvents\nIonic compounds are more soluble in polar solvents\n\nTemperature effect on the solubility of solids With increasing temperature, some solid soludes have larger solubility, some lower. There is no clear correlation between the sign of \\(\\Delta H_{soln}\\) and the variation of solubility with temperature.\nTemperature effect on the solubility of gases Higher temperature always results in lower solubility.\nPressure effect on the solubility of solids and liquids No influence.\nPressure effect on the solubility of gases Henry’s Law The solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the pressure of the gas over the solution assuming no chemical reaction occurs for solute and solvent. If the solute reacts with the solvent, such as \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) or \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) in water, Henry’s Law does not apply.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nRemember the concepts and the rules.\nPredict the relative solubility of different solutes in a given solvent."

Colligative Properties\nColligative properties are properties that depend only on the number of solute particles in solution and not on the nature of the solute particles.\nRaoult’s law: The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution.\nVapor-Pressure Lowering The vapor-pressure of the solvent decreases with the increasing mole fraction of the solute.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP_1 = X_1P_1^0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(X_1\\) is the mole fraction of the solvent; \\(P_1^0\\) is the vapor-pressure of the pure solvent; \\(P_1\\) is the vapor-pressure of the solvent over a solution.\nBoiling-Point Elevation and Freezing-Point Depression The boiling-point increases proportionally with the molality; The freezing-point decreases proportionally with the molality. The \\(K_b\\) and \\(K_f\\) values vary with the solvents. To do a calculation, the \\(K_b\\) and \\(K_f\\) values must be given. You can find those values for different solvents in the textbook and do not need to memorize them.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta T_b & = K_bm \\\\\n\\Delta T_f & = K_fm\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOsmotic Pressure\nSemipermeable membrane allows solvent molecules to pass through but blocks the passage of solute molecules.\nOsmosis is the net movement of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a pure solvent or from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution.\nOsmotic pressure (\\(\\pi\\)) of a solution is the pressure required to stop osmosis. Osmotic pressure is proportional to molarity.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\pi = MRT\n\\end{align*}\\]\nColligative Properties of Electrolyte Solutions\nProperties of electrolyte solutions have been covered in CHEM107. To remind yourself, you can read Ch11.2 in OpenStax textbook\nElectrolytes dissociate into ions in solution, and so one unit of an electrolyte compound separates into two or more particles when it dissolves. The colligitive properties depends on the total number of solute particles rather than the original unit of electrolyte compound.\nDefine\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ni = \\frac{\\text{actual number of particles in soln after dissociation}}{\\text{number of formula units initially dissolved in soln}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThen\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta T_b & = iK_bm \\\\\n\\Delta T_f & = iK_fm \\\\\n\\pi & = iMRT\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nExample: A solution contains 5.00 g of urea, \\(\\ce{CO(NH2)2}\\) (a nonvolatile solute) and 0.100 kg of water. If the vapor pressure of pure water at 25 °C is 23.7 torr, what is the vapor pressure of the solution assuming ideal behavior?\nAnswer: \n\\[\\begin{align*}    \n\\text{Moles of urea} & =5.00\\text{ g urea}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ mol urea}}{60.0\\text{ g urea}}\\\\\n& =0.0833\\text{ mol urea}\\\\\n\\text{Moles of water} & =100\\text{ g water}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ mol water}}{18.0\\text{ g water}}\\\\\n& =5.56\\text{ mol water}\\\\  \nX_{\\ce{H2O}} & =\\frac{5.56\\text{ mol water}}{5.56\\text{ mol water}+0.0833\\text{ mol urea}} \\\\\n& = 0.986  \\\\\nP & =X_{\\ce{H2O}}\\times P^0\\\\\n& =0.986\\times23.7\\text{ torr}\\\\\n& =23.4\\text{ torr}  \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: What is the boiling point of a solution of 1.0 g of glycerin, \\(\\ce{C3H5(OH)3}\\), in 47.8 g of water? Assume an ideal solution. (Boiling temperature of water is 100 °C, \\(K_b\\)=0.512 °C/m)\nAnswer: \nFirst, calculate the molality. Then, calculate the change of boiling point.\n\\[\\begin{align*}    \n\\text{Moles of glycerin} & =1.0\\text{ g glycerin}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ mol glycerin}}{92\\text{g glycerin}}\\\\\n& =0.011\\text{ mol glycerin} \\\\\nm & = \\frac{0.011\\text{ mol glycerin}}{0.0478\\text{ kg water}}\\\\\n& = 0.23\\text{ m}\\\\\n\\Delta T_b & = K_b\\times m \\\\\n& = 0.512\\text{ }^\\circ\\text{C/m}\\times 0.23\\text{ m} \\\\\n& = 0.12\\text{ }^\\circ\\text{C} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince the presence of solute would cause the boiling temperature to increase from 100 °C by 0.12 °C. The new boiling temperature is 100.12 °C.\n\n\nExample: Assuming ideal solution behavior, what is the osmotic pressure (atm) a solution with a volume of 0.750 L that contains 5.0 g of methanol, \\(\\ce{CH3OH}\\), in water at 37 °C?\nAnswer: \nFirst, calculate the molarity. Then, calculate the osmotic pressure.\n\\[\\begin{align*}    \n\\text{Moles of methanol} & =5.0\\text{ g methanol}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ mol methanol}}{32\\text{ g methanol}}\\\\\n& = 0.16\\text{ mol methanol}\\\\\nM & =\\frac{0.16\\text{ mol methanol}}{0.750\\text{ L solution}}\\\\\n& =0.21\\text{ M}  \\\\\n\\pi & =MRT\\\\\n& =0.21\\text{ M}\\times 0.0821\\text{ L atm/mol K} \\times (37+273)\\text{ K} \\\\\n& = 5.3\\text{ atm}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand what is colligative property.\nGiven the concentration of a solution, use the equations provided to calculate the vapor-pressure change, boiling and freezing point change and osmotic pressure.\nCalculate the molar mass based on osmotic pressure.\nUnderstand the difference between non-electrolytes and electrolytes."

Thus intermediats do not appear in the overall ballanced equation.\nmolecularity of a reaction is the number of molecules reacting in an elementary step, such as unimolecular reaction, bimolecular reaction and termolecular reaction.\nRate Laws of Elementary Reactions\n\\[a\\ce{A} +b\\ce{B} \\ce{->} c\\ce{C} +d\\ce{D}\\]\nIf this is an elementary reaction, then\n\\[\\begin{align}rate=k[\\ce{A}]^a[\\ce{B}]^b\\end{align}\\]\nSince an elementary reaction usually involves only one or two molecules, there are only a few possible types of elementary reactions, which are:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ce{A -> B}\\qquad & \\text{rate}=k[\\ce{A}]\\\\\n\\ce{2A -> B}\\qquad & \\text{rate}=k[\\ce{A}]^2\\\\\n\\ce{A + B -> C}\\qquad & \\text{rate}=k[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B}]\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTermolecular reaction is possible, but is rare. Kinetics of termolecular reactions is not discussed here.\nRate-determining step is the slowest step in the sequence of steps leading to product formation.\nThe rate-determining step should predict the same rate law as is determined experimentally. \nPotential energy profile for a multi-step reaction\n\nCompare the potential energy of reactants and products to get whether the overall reaction is exothermic or endothermic.\nThe maxima are the transition states; and the number of maxima tells the number of elementary steps.\nThe minima are intermediates (not including the reactions and the products).\nActivation energies are the defference of potential energies between reactants (or intermediates) and transition states.\nThe rate-determining step corresponds to the largest activation energy.\n\n\nExample: The two-step mechanism below has been proposed for a reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon mononoxide: \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{(1)}\\quad\\ce{2NO2(g) -> NO3(g) + NO(g)}\\qquad\\text{slow}\\\\\n& \\text{(2)}\\quad\\ce{NO3(g) + CO(g) -> NO2(g) + CO2(g)}\\qquad\\text{fast}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhat is the overall reaction? What is the intermediate? What is the overall rate law?\nAnswer: \nThe overall reaction is the sum of the two steps:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{2NO2(g) + NO3(g) + CO(g)\\\\\n& -> NO3(g) + NO(g) + NO2(g) + CO2(g)}    \n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis need to be simplified to:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ce{NO2(g) + CO(g) -> NO(g) + CO2(g)}    \n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe intermediate is \\(\\ce{NO3}\\).\nThe overall rate law equals to the slow step, which is \\(\\text{rate}=k[\\ce{NO2}]^2\\).\n\n\nRequirements\n1. Given elementary steps, identify the intermediates and write the overall balanced reaction equation.\n2. Knowing the rate-determining step of a reaction, tell the rate law of the overall reaction. Or knowing the rate law of a reaction and the elementary steps, tell which is the rate-determining step.\n3. Given the potential energy profile of a multi-step reaction, tell whether the overal reaction is exothermic or endothermic, the number of elementary steps, the intermediate(s), the transition states, the activation energies of each step, the rate-determining step."

A Brønsted acid is a substance capable of donating a proton, and a Brønsted base is a substance capable of accepting a proton.\nConjugate acid-base pair The conjugate base of a Brønsted acid is the species that remains when one proton has been removed from the acid. Conversely, a conjugate acid results from the addition of a proton to a Brønsted base.\n\nExample: Identify the conjugate acid-base pairs in the following reaction:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ce{CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) <=> CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nAnswer: \nIn this reaction, \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) is an acid, and \\(\\ce{CH3COO-}\\) is its conjugate base; \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) is a base, and \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) is its conjugate acid.\n\nDiprotic and Polyprotic Acids\n\nMay yield more than one hydrogen ion per molecule;\nIonize in a stepwise manner;\nEach ionization step has a ionization constant.\n\n\nExample: Give the reaction equations of the two-step ionization of \\(\\ce{H2CO3}\\) in water. \nAnswer:  \\[\\ce{H2CO3 (aq) + H2O (l) <=> H3O+ (aq) +HCO3- (aq)} \\quad \\textbf{(1)}\\]\n\\[K_{a_1}=\\frac{[\\ce{H3O+}][\\ce{HCO3-}]}{[\\ce{H2CO3}]}\\]\n\\[\\ce{HCO3- (aq) + H2O (l) <=> H3O+ (aq) + CO3^2- (aq)} \\quad \\textbf{(2)}\\]\n\\[K_{a_2}=\\frac{[\\ce{H3O+}][\\ce{CO3^2-}]}{[\\ce{HCO3-}]}\\]\n\n\n\nThe Acid and Base Properties of Water\n\\[\\ce{H2O + H2O <=> H3O+ + OH-}\\]\nor\n\\[\\ce{H2O <=> H+ + OH-}\\]\nat \\(25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}\\)\n\\[K_w = [\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}]=1.0\\times10^{-14}\\]\npH - A Measure of Acidity \\[\\ce{pH}=-\\log [\\ce{H+}]\\]\nIn water, at \\(25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}\\), \\(\\ce{pH}=7\\) means the solution is neutral; \\(\\ce{pH}<7\\), acidic; \\(\\ce{pH}>7\\), basic.\n\\(\\ce{pOH}\\) can be defined as \\[\\ce{pOH}=-\\log [\\ce{OH-}]\\]\nSince \\(K_w = [\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}]=1.0\\times10^{-14}\\), \\(\\ce{pH}+\\ce{pOH} = 14\\).

The acid can react with any added \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) and the base can react with any added \\(\\ce{H+}\\).\nAn example is a solution with comparable amounts of \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) and \\(\\ce{CH3COONa}\\). \\(\\ce{CH3COONa}\\) ionize completely in water to give:\n\\[\\ce{CH3COONa ->[\\ce{H2O}] CH3COO- (aq) + Na+ (aq)}\\]\nIf an acid is added, \\(\\ce{H+}\\) will be consumed by \\(\\ce{CH3COO-}\\)\n\\[\\ce{CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq) -> CH3COOH (aq)}\\]\nIf a base is added, \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) will be consumed by \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\)\n\\[\\ce{CH3COOH(aq) + OH- (aq) -> CH3COO- (aq) + H2O (l)}\\]\nThis buffer system can be written as either \\(\\ce{CH3COONa/CH3COOH}\\) or \\(\\ce{CH3COO- /CH3COOH}\\).\n\nCalculate the \\(\\ce{pH}\\) of a Buffer System\n\nExample: (a) Calculate the pH of a buffer system containing 1.0 M \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) and 1.0 M \\(\\ce{CH3COONa}\\).\nAnswer: \nStrategy: Note the initial concentrations of \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) and \\(\\ce{CH3COO-}\\) are both 1.0 M.

Entropy\nSpontaneous Processes\nA reaction that does occur under the given set of conditions is called a spontaneous reaction.\nTwo factors determine if a process occur spontaneously. 1. Release or absorb heat; 2.

The unit of entropy is J/K.\n\\[S = k \\ln W\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is Boltzmann constant (\\(1.38\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J/K}\\)), \\(W\\) is the number of microstates. The unit of entroy is J/K.\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of \\(N\\) particles distributed among \\(n\\) boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is \\(n^N\\). For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in \\(2^4 = 16\\) different microstates as illustrated in the figure.\n\nMicrostates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. In this example, there are 5 possible states. Distribution (a), all 4 particles are in the left box, has only one possible microstate; while distribution (c), 2 particles in the left box and 2 particles in the right box, has 6 microstates. Thus the entropy of state (c) is greater than that of state (a). Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\nState functions are properties that are determined by the state of the system, regardless of how that condition was achieved.\nEntropy is a state function. Thus,\n\\[\\Delta S = S_\\text{f} - S_\\text{i}=k\\ln W_\\text{f} - k\\ln W_\\text{i} = k\\ln\\frac{W_\\text{f}}{W_\\text{i}}\\]\nwhere, \\(S_\\text{i}\\) and \\(S_\\text{f}\\) mean the entropy of the initial and final states. No matter how does the system go from one state to another, as long as the initial and final states are the same, the change of entropy is the same.\nStandard Entropy (\\(S^\\ominus\\)) is the absolute entropy of a substance at 1 atm and usually quoted with its value at 25 \\(^\\circ\\)C.

    "text": "2. The Laws of Thermodynamics\nAn alternate statement of the laws of thermodynamics:\n\nZeroth law of thermodynamics: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. (If A and B have the same temperature, B and C have the same temperature, A and C must also have the same temperature.)\n\nFirst law of thermodynamics: When energy passes, as work, as heat, or with matter, into or out from a system, the system’s internal energy changes in accord with the law of conservation of energy. (Energy can be converted from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed.)\n\nSecond law of thermodynamics: In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases. (The sum of the entropy change of a system and that of the surroundings ,i.e., the entropy change of the whole universe, must always increases. )\n\nThird law of thermodynamics: The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero, and is equal to the logarithm of the product of the quantum ground states. (The entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.)\n\nSecond Law\nConsider the universe as a whole, the total amount of energy is constant (First Law). The universe cannot release or gain energy from “outside”. If a process can happen spontaneously, it must cause the total entropy of the universe increase (Second Law).\nWhen the entropy of the universe reaches a maximum value, which means the universe reaches a thermodynamic equilibrium , no processes that increase entropy (including computation and life) can be sustained any more. This state is called the heat death of the universe which is a possible ultimate fate of the universe.\nThird Law\nThe important point about the third law of thermodynamics is that it enables us to determine the absolute entropies of substances.\nExample: Diamond should have \\(S=0\\) at 0 K. The standard entropy \\(S^\\ominus\\) you find here means the entropy of 1 mol substance at 25 \\(^\\circ\\)C and 1 atm. For diamond the value is \\(S^\\ominus = 2.4\\) J/K. Higher temperature results in higher entropy.\n\nRequirements\n1. Understand these laws of thermodynamics."

    "text": "3. Free Energy\nDefination of Free Energy\nIf a system releases heat to the surroundings (the rest of the universe), the entropy of the surroundings will increase. If a system absorb heat from the surroundings, the entropy of the surroundings will decrease.

Thus,\n\n\\(\\Delta G < 0\\), the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction;\n\n\\(\\Delta G > 0\\), the reaction is nonspontaneous, while the reverse reaction is spontaneous;\n\n\\(\\Delta G = 0\\), the system is at equilibrium. There is no net change.\n\n\nFree energy is a state function. If a process takes several steps, the overall change of free energy equals the sum of the free energy changes of individual steps.\nStandard Free Energy Changes\nThe standard free energy of reaction (\\(\\Delta G^\\ominus_\\text{rxn}\\)) is the free energy change for a reaction when it occurs under standard-state conditions (25 °C and 1 atm).\nFor a reaction:\n\\[\\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}\\]\nThe standard free energy of reaction \\(\\Delta G^\\ominus_\\text{rxn}\\) is:\n\\[\\Delta G^\\ominus_\\text{rxn}=[c\\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{C})+d\\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{D})]-[a\\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{A})+d\\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{B})]\\]\nWhere \\(\\Delta G^\\ominus_f\\) is the standard free energy of formation of a compound, that is, the free-energy change that occurs when 1 mole of the compound is synthesized from its elements in their standard states. We define the standard free energy of formation of any element in its stable allotropic form at 1 atm and 25 °C as zero. The values of \\(\\Delta G^\\ominus_f\\) can be found here.\nTemperature and Chemical Reactions The forward direction of the following reaction is endothermic\n\\[\\ce{CaCO3(s) <=> CaO(s) + CO2(g)}\\]\nAccording to LeChatelier’s principle, the reaction shifts towards right side under higher temperature. Same conclusion should be obtained if we look at the free energy change.\nAt 25 °C, \\(\\Delta H^\\ominus = 177.8\\,\\text{kJ/mol} > 0\\); \\(\\Delta S^\\ominus = 160.5\\,\\text{J/K}\\cdot\\text{mol} > 0\\). Thus, \\(\\Delta G^\\ominus= \\Delta H^\\ominus - T\\Delta S^\\ominus = 130.0\\,\\text{kJ/mol} > 0\\). This reaction does not take place spontaneously at room temperature.\nAt what temperature will this reaction occur? Let \\(\\Delta G^\\ominus= \\Delta H^\\ominus - T\\Delta S^\\ominus = 0\\), assuming \\(\\Delta H^\\ominus\\) and \\(\\Delta S^\\ominus\\) does not change, we get \\(T = 1108\\,\\text{K}\\) which is 835 °C. At this temperature the equilibrium pressure of \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) reaches 1 atm. Above 835 °C, the equilibrium pressure of \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) exceeds 1 atm.\nPhase Transitions\nThe melting point of ice is 0 °C under 1 atm means at this temperature the change between water and ice is at equilibrium (\\(\\Delta G = 0\\)).\n\\[\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S=0\\]\n\\[\\Delta S = \\frac{\\Delta H}{T}\\]\nAt 0 °C the phase change from ice to water has \\(\\Delta H = 6.01\\,\\text{kJ/mol}\\) and \\(\\Delta S = 22.0\\,\\text{J/K}\\cdot\\text{mol}\\)\nSimilarly, water boils at 100 °C under 1 atm means liquid water and steam reach an equilibrium under this condition.\nFree Energy and Chemical Equilibrium\n\\[\\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\ominus + RT \\ln Q\\]\n\\(R\\) is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mol), \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature, and \\(Q\\) is the reaction quotient. For gas phase equilibria, the pressure-based reaction quotient, \\(Q_P\\), is used (bedause for gases standard states mean under 1 atm rather than 1 mol/L). The concentration-based reaction quotient, \\(Q_C\\), is used for condensed phase equilibria.\nWhen the reaction reaches equilibrium \\(\\Delta G = 0\\) and \\(Q= K\\), thus\n\\[0 = \\Delta G^\\ominus + RT \\ln K\\]\n\\[\\Delta G^\\ominus =- RT \\ln K\\]\nIf \\(Q < K\\), then \\(\\Delta G < 0\\) and the reaction proceeds from left to right;\nIf \\(Q > K\\), then \\(\\Delta G > 0\\) and the reaction proceeds from right to left.\n\nExample: Calculate the standard free energy of the following reaction at 25 °C. \\[\\ce{4Fe(s) + 3O2 (g) -> 2Fe2O3(s)}\\] \nAnswer:  First, find out the standard free energy of formation of \\(\\ce{Fe(s)}\\), \\(\\ce{O2 (g)}\\) and \\(\\ce{Fe2O3(s)}\\) are 0, 0 and -824.2 kJ/mol.\n\\[\\begin{align*}    \n\\Delta G^\\ominus_\\text{rxn} = & 2\\times \\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{Fe2O3}) - [4\\times \\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{Fe}) + 3\\times \\Delta G^\\ominus_f(\\ce{O2})]\\\\\n    = & 2\\times(-824.2\\text{ kJ/mol}) - [4\\times 0 + 3\\times 0]\\\\\n    = & -1648.4\\text{ kJ/mol}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: Calculate the boiling point of \\(\\ce{CH2Cl2}\\) under 1 atm from \\(\\Delta H^\\ominus_\\text{f}\\) and \\(S^\\ominus\\) of liquid and gaseous \\(\\ce{CH2Cl2}\\).

    "text": "1. Redox Reactions\nRedox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process.\n\nOxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n\nReduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this example, \\(\\ce{Na}\\) loses one electron becoming \\(\\ce{Na+}\\). We call this process the oxidation of \\(\\ce{Na}\\). Simultaneously, \\(\\ce{F}\\) gains one electron becoming \\(\\ce{F-}\\). This process is called the reduction of \\(\\ce{F}\\).\nReducing agent is an element or compound that loses (or “donates”) an electron to another chemical species in a redox chemical reaction. Since the reducing agent is losing electrons, it is said to have been oxidized.\nOxidizing agent is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to lose electrons). In a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent itself is reduced.\n\nOxidation Number\nThe oxidation state, often called the oxidation number, is an indicator of the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state, which may be positive, negative or zero, is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic, with no covalent component.\n\nThe oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero.\nFor a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion.\nHydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of −2 when they are present in most compounds. Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of −1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g. \\(\\ce{LiH}\\), and oxygen has an oxidation state of −1 in peroxides, e.g. \\(\\ce{H2O2}\\).\nGroup IA metals have oxidation states of +1; IIA metals have +2. Fluorine always has an oxidation state of -1.\nThe algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion.\n\n\n\nBalancing Redox Equations\nBalance the equation showing the oxidation of \\(\\ce{Fe^2+}\\) ions to \\(\\ce{Fe^3+}\\) ions by \\(\\ce{Cr2O7^2-}\\) in an acidic medium. The \\(\\ce{Cr2O7^2-}\\) ions are reduced to \\(\\ce{Cr^3+}\\).\n\nWrite the unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form.\n\\[\\ce{Fe^2+ + Cr2O6^2- -> Fe^3+ + Cr^3+}\\]\n\nSeparate the equation into two half-reactions.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{Oxidation:}\\qquad\\ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+} \\\\\n& \\text{Reduction:}\\qquad\\ce{Cr2O7^2- -> Cr^3+}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nBalance the atoms other than O and H in each half-reaction.\n\\[\\ce{Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+}\\]\n\nFor reactions in acid, add \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) to balance O atoms and \\(\\ce{H+}\\) to balance H atoms.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{Cr2O7^2- -> 2 Cr^3+ + 7H2O}\\\\\n& \\ce{14H+ + Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+ + 7H2O}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nAdd electrons to one side of each half-reaction to balance the charges. \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ + 1e-} \\\\\n& \\ce{6e- + 14H+ + Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+ + 7H2O}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf necessary, equalize the number of electrons in the two half-reactions.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{6Fe^2+ -> 6Fe^3+ + 6e-} \\\\\n& \\ce{6e- + 14H+ + Cr2O7^2- -> 2Cr^3+ + 7H2O}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nAdd the two half-reactions together and balance the final equation.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ce{14H+ + Cr2O7^2- + 6Fe^2+ -> 6Fe^3+ + 2Cr^3+ + 7 H2O}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nVerify that the number of atoms and the charges are balanced.\n\nIf the reactions is in basic solutions, for each \\(\\ce{H+}\\) add equal number of \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) to both side of the reaction. Combine \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) and \\(\\ce{H+}\\) to form water.\n\nTo simplify the procedure, remember the following. First, separate the equation into tow half-reactions; secondly, balance the number of atoms; thirdly, balance the number of charges; finally, combine into one overal equation.\n\nExample: Balance the following equation assuming the reaction occurs (a) in an acidic solution; and (b) in a basic solution.  \\[\\ce{H2O2 + Sn^{2+} -> H2O + Sn^{4+}}\\]\nAnswer: \n(a)\n* Separate the equation into two half-reactions.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{Oxidation:}\\qquad\\ce{Sn^2+ -> Sn^4+} \\\\\n& \\text{Reduction:}\\qquad\\ce{H2O2 -> H2O}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nBalance the atoms other than O and H in each half-reaction.

The Nature of Nuclear Reactions\nAtomic Number (Z): The number of protons in nucleus.\nMass Number (A): The number of protons and neutrons in nucleus.\nAn atom X with atomic number Z and mass number A can be expressed as:\n\\[\\ce{^{A}_{Z}X}\\]\nTwo types of nuclear reactions:\n\nRadioactivity Decay is spontaneous decay of unstable nuclei during which process particles and/or electromagnetic radiation are emitted.\n\nNuclear Transmutation results from the bombardment of nuclei by neutrons, protons, or other nuclei.\n\n\nBalancing Nuclear Equations\n\nMass number conservation;\nCharge conservation.\n\nComparison of chemical reactions and nuclear reactions. The most important difference is chemical reactions do not break atoms while nuclear reactions do.\n\nExample: The nuclide \\(\\ce{^{125}_{53}I}\\) combines with an electron and produces a new nucleus and no other massive particles. What is the equation for this reaction?\nAnswer:  (1) An electron would not change the mass number of the atom, so the mass number of the new atom should be \\(125+0=125\\);\n(2) The charge must be balanced before and after the reaction, so the atomic number of the new atom should be \\(53+(-1)=52\\);\n(3) The 52nd element is Te.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\ce{^{125}_{53}I + ^0_{-1}e -> ^{125}_{52}Te}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: The reaction of an \\(\\alpha\\) particle with magnesium-25 (\\(\\ce{^{25}_{12}Mg}\\)) produces a proton and a nuclide of another element. Identify the new nuclide produced.\nAnswer: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\ce{^{25}_{12}Mg + ^4_2He -> ^1_1H + ^{28}_{13}Al}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nNuclear Stability\n\nCertain numbers (2, 8, 20, 50, 82, or 126) of neutrons and protons are more stable than others.\nNuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons are generally more stable than those with odd numbers of these particles.\nAll isotopes of the elements with atomic numbers higher than 83 are radioactive. All isotopes of Tc and Pm are radioactive.\n\nNuclear Binding Energy: The energy required to break up a nucleus into its component protons and neutrons.\nExample \\(\\ce{^19_9F}\\) contains 9 protons, 10 neutrons and 9 electrons. The mass of 9 protons, 10 neutrons and 9 electrons is\n\\[9\\times 1.0073\\,\\text{amu}+10\\times 1.0087\\,\\text{amu}+9\\times0.00055\\text{ amu}=19.15765\\,\\text{amu}\\] The mass of a \\(\\ce{^19_9F}\\) atom is \\(18.9984\\,\\text{amu}\\).\nThe difference in mass is associated with the energy required to break up a nucleus into its component protons and neutrons.\n\\[E=mc^2\\] Thus \\[\\Delta E = (\\Delta m)c^2\\] In this example, \\(\\Delta m = -0.15925\\,\\text{amu}\\) and \\(\\Delta E = -2.377\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{J}\\) per atom. For one mole atoms, \\(\\Delta E = -1.431\\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{kJ/mol}\\). The negative sign means the formation of the atom would release energy to the environment. Some textbooks do not include the negative sign but state the direction of energy flow in words.\nSince there are 19 nucleons in one atom. The nuclear binding energy per nucleon is \\(\\Delta E = -2.377\\times 10^{-11}/19 = -1.251\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{J}\\).\nIn nuclear science, MeV is widely used as the unit for energy. \\(1\\text{ MeV}=1.602\\times10^{-13}\\text{ J}\\). Thus, the binding energy per \\(\\ce{^19_9F}\\) atom is \\(-148.4\\text{ MeV}\\)\nNuclei with larger nuclear binding energy per nucleon is more stable.\n\nExample: Calculate the nuclear binding energy for the nuclide \\(\\ce{^56_26Fe}\\) in (a) J per nucleus; (b) J per mole of nuclei; (c) MeV per nucleus; (d) MeV per nucleon.

The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) it contains begins to decrease as the \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the amount of \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) there is to be detected, and because the half-life of \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by radiocarbon dating are around 50,000 years ago.\n\\[\\ce{^14_6C -> ^14_7N + ^0_{-1}\\beta}+\\gamma\\]\nSince this reaction is a first order reaction, the half-life is a constant value.\n\nExample: A tiny piece of paper (produced from formerly living plant matter) taken from the Dead Sea Scrolls has an activity of 10.8 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. If the initial C-14 activity was 13.6 disintegrations/min/g of C, estimate the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls. (The half-life of C-14 is 5730 years:) \nAnswer: \nThe C-14 activity is proportional to its concentration. The information from the question tells the concentration of C-14 changed by a factor of 10.8/13.6 after this piece of paper was produced.\nThe decay of C-14 is a first order reaction. Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\n    t_{1/2}=\\frac{\\ln2}{k}\\\\\n    \\ln\\frac{c_0}{c}=kt\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFrom the first equation we can calculate the reaction rate constant. From the second equation we can calculate the reaction time.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    k & =\\frac{\\ln2}{t_{1/2}}\\\\\n    & = \\frac{\\ln2}{5730\\text{ y}}\\\\\n    & = 1.210\\times10^{-4}\\text{ y}^{-1}\\\\\n    t & = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{c_0}{c}}{k}\\\\\n    & = \\frac{\\ln\\frac{13.6}{10.8}}{1.210\\times10^{-4}\\text{ y}^{-1}}\\\\\n    & = 1.90\\times10^3\\text{ y}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, we can conclude that this piece of paper was produced around 1900 years ago.\n\n\nRequirements\n1. Understand what are alpha decay and beta decay;\n2. Understand how to date a sample knowing the amount of \\(\\ce{^14C}\\) it contains. Use the method discussed in Chapter 14 Chemical Kinetics."

    "text": "3. Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion\nNuclear Fission is the process in which a heavy nucleus (mass number > 200) divides to form smaller nuclei of intermediate mass and one or more neutrons.\nExample\n\\[\\ce{^235_92U + ^1_0n -> ^90_38Sr + ^143_54Xe + 3^1_0n}\\]\nIn this process, one neutron is captured while three neutrons are produced. The resulting neutons can trigger further reactions. This property makes possible a nuclear chain reaction, which is a self-sustaining sequence of nuclear fission reactions.\nFor such a chain reaction to occur, enough uranium-235 must be present in the sample to capture the neutrons generated in the fission reaction. Otherwise, many of the neutrons will escape from the sample and the chain reaction will not occur. In this situation, the mass of the sample is said to be subcritical. When the amount of the fissionable material is equal to or greater than the critical mass, the minimum mass of fissionable material required to generate a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, most of the neutrons will be captured by uranium-235 nuclei, and a chain reaction will occur.\nAtomic Bomb Two separated pieces of U-235 at subcritical masses. When triggered, those two pieces are pushed to merge and exceed the critical mass. Then chain reaction happens to cause explosion.\nNuclear Reactors Several pieces of U-235 at subcritical masses. Nuclear fission happens mildly without causing explosion. Control rods are used to adjust the reaction speed.\nNuclear Fusion is the combining of small nuclei into larger ones. Fusion reactions take place only at very high temperatures.\nExamples\nReactions happen in the Sun.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{^1_1H +^2_1H -> ^3_2He} \\\\\n& \\ce{^3_2He + ^3_2He -> ^4_2He + 2^1_1H} \\\\\n& \\ce{^1_1H + ^1_1H -> ^2_1H + ^0_{+1}\\beta}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nReactions happen in a Hydrogen Bomb\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\ce{^6_3Li +^2_1H -> 2^4_2\\alpha} \\\\\n& \\ce{^2_1H + ^2_1H -> ^3_1H + ^1_1H}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nRequirements\n1.

Thus, using scientific notation is recommended to avoid the ambiguity.\n\nHandling significant figures in calculations\n\nIn addition and subtraction, the answer cannot have more digits to the right or the decimal point than either of the original numbers.\nIn multiplication and division, the number of significant figures in the final product or quotient is determined by the original number that has the smallest number of significant figures.\nExact numbers obtained from definitions or by counting numbers of objects can be considered to have an infinite number of significant figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Accuracy and Precision\nAccuracy tells us how close a measurement is to the true value of the quantity that was measured.\nPrecision refers to how closely two or more measurements of the same quantity agree with one another.\n\n\n3.4 Significant Figures in Measurement\nThe numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface of the liquid. In the following figure, the bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid’s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL. \n\nExample: Determine the number of significant figures.
